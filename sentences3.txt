3 => prologue in the oldest fields of space , beyond the farthest galaxies , at the edge of the cosmos , shines a solitary light . 
4 => it is moving forward through a glorious vaulted arc on an inevitable journey . 
5 => the object sears the emptiness with fire and ice : a comet racing across the heavens . 
6 => millions of millions of years pass unheeded as the trailing time-traveller flies on , until it becomes a speck of light in some ancient eye . 
7 => the light grows by night , seen by the first ancestor , for the earth is still young . 
8 => it streaks by , screaming through the skies , and flies into the void seeming to be forever travelling on , but one day to return . 
9 => millennia pass . 
10 => the circuit of the comet will lead to its own destruction as the flare grows once more in the night sky . 
11 => this time around , it does not pass by , but crashes with devastating destruction onto the surface of the planet that we now call our home . 
12 => it lodges , a small piece of foreign matter , beneath the skin of the earth and slowly cools . 
13 => in time , it is forgotten . 
14 => the ages pass ; continents take shape and shift , ever moving , into new forms . 
15 => inside the crust of this living place , the comet has lost its outer shell to reveal within , a single massive crystal . 
16 => it is buried beneath a hill , now an island . 
17 => the crystal grows and begets another and another , until all the material of the comet has been consumed . 
18 => within this secret place , yet unfound , the crystals wait , clear and pure , a substance not of this earth . 
19 => they are formed of materials beyond our comprehension , the essence of time distilled by destiny to be a part of our future . 
20 => chapter one - big city lights it is late and the night outside is black . 
21 => the small wooden box lies open and i hold the two clear gemstones in my hand . 
22 => the firelight plays across the facets of the crystals . 
23 => once again , i remember . 
24 => the book lies open on my desk and i turn to read the words i have written . 
25 => the desk light reflects against the black glass of the window . 
26 => below me the town is dark and silently asleep . 
27 => i open the window and i can hear the sea as it breaks against the shore . 
28 => everything on this island is close to the sea . 
29 => the smell of salt and seaweed permeates the fabric of our lives . 
30 => the wash of the waves and the fiery crackle of the pebbles rasping on the beach play a constant background rhythm to every thought . 
31 => over the sea , the clouds part for a moment . 
32 => there is a sudden glance of moonlight on the wave tops and the momentary , flowing canvas of deep marine blue caresses the eyes like a mirage . 
33 => these sensations are always near . 
34 => the clouds close again , yet in the deep of night , i still sense the movement of the sea far below . 
35 => my mind wanders beyond the confines of the night to this island , to my home , to suidhe . 
36 => the sea controls the lives of everyone here . 
37 => we live and die by the will of water and weather . 
38 => ever changing , she exudes emotion , temper and free will like a living thing . 
39 => i have seen the gentlest waters kiss the rocks with a murmuring ebb and flow . 
40 => i have felt the earth jarring beneath the shuddering crash of stormy mountain waves that shout at the rocks in anger . 
41 => on either side of the town , low earthy cliffs rise above the pebbly beaches . 
42 => here and there , glistening peaty streams tumble down waterfalls to the shore and into the waves . 
43 => in the late summer the seals bask and play on the rocks that emerge from the water like broken teeth beyond the cliffs . 
44 => all the while , the endless turmoil of gulls patrols the sky above . 
45 => this eastern coast is sheltered from the extremes of the weather and is softer and gentler than the exposed western shore . 
46 => the rocky coves and inlets , hidden in the folds of the hills , reach green fingers out from the island to touch the waters edge . 
47 => streams rise from the springs on the hills , at the centre of the island , and fall dancing down through small ravines . 
48 => they gather into a river that flows across the plateau above the sea cliffs . 
49 => the waters surge down the final valley and pass into a stony estuary which shelters between steep wooded hills down to the old bridge . 
50 => this small town is my home and lies on the lowest part of the coast . 
51 => here , we face bravely out across the water towards the mainland and the big city , a glistening ribbon of light on the horizon . 
52 => on the mainland our town would just be a modest village but here on our small island , it is the centre of living and proudly considered a town . 
53 => oldford is a quiet , slow , settled place with winding streets that climb above the harbour . 
54 => the old houses rise from the stony ground on either side of these steep lanes . 
55 => they stand one above the other so that it seems each one perches on the roof of the house below . 
56 => the stone in the walls was hewn from the old quarries in the hills , even the roofs are tiled with slabs of stone . 
57 => these old houses emerge from the hills with seamless continuity , grey and hard . 
58 => yet the stone has softened with the ages and the weathered walls are covered with lichens and moss pillows the roofs . 
59 => on the western side of the island , the storms blow in , wild and windy , from the vastness of the empty ocean and batter the ragged shore . 
60 => gulls and gannets noisily cruise the air above the stony heights and ceaseless waves . 
61 => cool , dark caves pierce some of the steeper cliffs , issuing streams from their ferny shadows . 
62 => few trees grow here , where the salty wind stunts the growth of all living things . 
63 => one sheltered inlet hides behind a spur of rock that curves around a small bay and the foaming sea pounds turbulently through the entrance to this natural harbour . 
64 => it carves the rocks and cliffs into gullies with the rise and fall of stormy tides . 
65 => the small fishing village of newbridge shelters in a gap between the ragged cliffs . 
66 => the grey-brown rock walls protect it from the worst winter gales . 
67 => buildings cluster around the inner harbour . 
68 => the tiny , bleak , shed-like cottages are solid and low . 
69 => they have small shuttered windows and heavily braced doors . 
70 => the wildest winter will not penetrate those solid white walls . 
71 => inside , each parlour is a cosy place and the rosy cheer of peat firelight flickers on faces in friendly warmth . 
72 => the whitewashed walls and turf-covered roofs are home to no more than a hundred inhabitants , but only four families . 
73 => a dozen small fishing boats rest with their keels in the mud , awaiting the tide to rise . 
74 => then , the stalwart fishermen : uncles , cousins , sons and fathers , will sail them out to sea once again . 
75 => meantime , while the boats are out , the womenfolk keep house and garden , praying all the while for good weather , a good catch and a safe return . 
76 => life on suidhe is always about the weather . 
77 => midnight storms give way to silent calm dawns . 
78 => bluster winds free the days from the monotony of drumming rain . 
79 => strange and enclosing fog binds everything in cold , close , wet white . 
80 => but clouds fade as quickly as the sun to rise again , in perfect blue mornings , bathed by the happiness of a refreshing early light . 
81 => oldford and newbridge are the only settlements on the island . 
82 => a single road rises up the valleys to the cliffs and winds its way between them . 
83 => it follows the coastline around past south point and stony haven . 
84 => the centre of the island is too hilly for roads to traverse . 
85 => there , the goat tracks and old drovers ways twist and climb their way up the tight valleys , until they reach the broken moors that surround the rocky heart , but these tracks are only narrow ways . 
86 => in the south and the east the valleys are spread with small fields cultivated by centuries of fishermens wives , who tilled the land while their men folk were at sea . 
87 => the north and west remain untamed and wild where great herds of deer roam freely in the valleys we call the deer gardens . 
88 => i spent my childhood on this island . 
89 => there were not many children then , there are fewer today . 
90 => in our free time , we filled our lives with the ancient pastimes , uncorrupted by most of the modern world . 
91 => we helped in the home . 
92 => we helped with the crops and animals . 
93 => we helped on the boats when the weather was fine . 
94 => playing , exploring , adventuring together and alone , we came to know and understand our island home . 
95 => we spent the evenings by the fire with our families , or alone , reading in our rooms . 
96 => the distant sound of voices raised in song issued from houses and tavern to break the silence of the dark winter evenings . 
97 => some thought the old ways would never end while others , less comfortable , saw through the idyll to a harsher reality . 
98 => but we were not adrift on the ocean and the twinkling lights on the horizon stayed ever present in our minds . 
99 => it stood curving and coaxing our thoughts into temptation , to cross the sea . 
100 => life on the island was changing . 
101 => we were still insular but not completely isolated from the mainland . 
102 => early every morning , a ferry came in to dock at the harbour , bringing provisions and visitors . 
103 => it then returned to the mainland , taking some of the men from the island to the big city , where they worked . 
104 => each evening the ferry repeated the trip . 
105 => the ferry became our lifeline , as regular as the tides . 
106 => without it , we could no longer survive . 
107 => ***** it is late ; i can hear the parlour clock striking two , calling me to sleep . 
108 => but i will work just a little longer . 
109 => i should tell you who i am . 
110 => my name is harold small , harry to everyone who knows me . 
111 => i live in this old cottage , near the steep top of the steep hill in oldford that overlooks the harbour and the sea . 
112 => sometimes , on autumn days , i see smoke rising lazily from squat chimneys below me ; it drifts out and hangs in a pall above the valley and obscures the cottages . 
113 => but now , as i sit in my room and look out through the dark window , i can see across to the mainland and the big city . 
114 => the lights of the city shine and twinkle on the horizon like a distant fairground floating on a sea of black . 
115 => i look at those lights and i remember back to when i was a lad thirty years ago and the things i did then . 
116 => you see , i went to the big city , a long time ago , and this is the story of how i came to go there and why i shall never go back . 
117 => i can see it all quite clearly in my mind . 
118 => it was late in the summer holidays of my sixteenth year and once again i went down to the old harbour at oldford . 
119 => i loved the island but i was an eager teenager . 
120 => i wanted a change , a chance to break free from these close confines . 
121 => i yearned for distance , excitement , for life on a grander scale . 
122 => there was not much for me to do here and always i dreamed of going over the sea to the big city . 
123 => some nights , long after dark , i would get up , go to the front window , look out across the water and watch that shimmering horizon . 
124 => each night i would dream about life in the big city , the glittering lights and glittering dreams , dreams that had no hold in reality . 
125 => our island is ancient and remote , and years ago the roads were only stony paths . 
126 => when i was a boy there were few vehicles on the island , just two or three old tractors and some bicycles . 
127 => i longed so much to see all the exciting things that i had heard about and , most of all , i longed to be in the big city at night and to see the big city lights . 
128 => but instead i was sitting on the quayside watching others go . 
129 => my best friend was a lad about my age called frank and he had been to the big city with his father twice that year . 
130 => he never stopped talking about it : the sights , the cars , the shops , the ships , the people . 
131 => everything he had seen was the biggest , the brightest , the grandest , the best , and i wanted to see it all , too . 
132 => you should see the roads , harry , theyre so wide and long and straight . 
133 => and theyve got golden fountains in the city square shaped like lions only much bigger . 
134 => there are buildings so high you cant see the roof . 
135 => its wonderful and fantastic , frank went on and all he said enthralled me . 
136 => one day soon im going to go there at night , bragged frank . 
137 => my father promised . 
138 => in the big city they dont have night , i replied . 
139 => the big city lights never stop shining , i said sullenly . 
140 => then i added , can i come too ? 
141 => frank shook his head . 
142 => no , harry , your father wont let you , remember ? 
143 => i knew he was right and looked down , but in my head i heard a familiar voice calling out in song : big city lights turn night into day ; the sounds and the sights take you away to a magical land of neon and gold where life never stops and no one grows old : the big city lights up the sky . 
144 => only yesterday i had asked my father : can i go soon ? 
145 => i pleaded . 
146 => please ? 
147 => no , came the simple reply . 
148 => youre too young . 
149 => ive seen youngsters twice your age go there and never come back ! 
150 => why not ? 
151 => franks going again , i persisted . 
152 => one day , no doubt , you will see for yourself . 
153 => i can tell you , life is hard in the big city . 
154 => not all that glitters is gold , you know . 
155 => i knew my father was exaggerating . 
156 => after all , my best friends father went there once a month and he always came back . 
157 => it wasnt that my father was a hard man or unfriendly . 
158 => he was the teacher at the island school and inclined to be jovial and serious all at once . 
159 => we got along fine but there was something about the big city he didnt like and that only made it seem more fascinating to me . 
160 => often i sat by the harbour making up plans for escape and adventure . 
161 => the hill behind my house curved up steeply into a jagged cliff that passed within a few feet of the walls . 
162 => if no one was watching , it was possible to jump out of a rear window and onto a ledge of rock that jutted out over the back garden . 
163 => sometimes , i would creep out secretly and leave the window open for my return . 
164 => my father would have been horrified and angry if he had known i was being so foolish as to leap across . 
165 => but it never entered my thoughts that it might be dangerous . 
166 => if only i could slip silently down to the harbour one evening after dark and climb aboard the ferry just before she sailed , then i would be able to hide away on board . 
167 => when we arrived at the mainland i would explore the big city all night . 
168 => after the ferry had returned to the island in the morning , i would run up the hill and climb into the house just in time to go downstairs to breakfast . 
169 => no one would ever know that i had been away ; it would be my secret . 
170 => the plan would never work , of course . 
171 => the problems seemed insurmountable . 
172 => how could i avoid being seen ? 
173 => how could i board the ferry without buying a ticket ? 
174 => i certainly could not afford the fare . 
175 => i never gave a thought to what would happen to me if i was caught . 
176 => i racked my brains for weeks , without success , to find a way of crossing the sea , but i rejected each idea at the outset . 
177 => the island isolation seemed complete , until one day something happened which gave illogical hope to my plan . 
178 => close to the centre of the island there is a hill called sgurr-cavan , which raises its rocky summit higher than all the others . 
179 => you can view the sea around the compass from the top . 
180 => the islanders call it the temple of the wind . 
181 => it is a good name ; it is always windy there . 
182 => i had heard there was an old island legend about the place but no-one seemed to know it . 
183 => i only knew it had something to do with going to the mainland . 
184 => time passed and i found out nothing more . 
185 => if i asked people about the old legend , they just laughed at me , or worse , they wanted to know why i was so interested . 
186 => of course , i couldnt tell them . 
187 => i concluded that no one knew the information i sought . 
188 => every day , whatever the weather , an old fisherman would wander slowly down to the quayside and watch the boats . 
189 => his name was eric , although everyone called him old eric . 
190 => all the boat crews knew him and they would stop and tell him their news from the sea . 
191 => he loved to hear their tales and tell his own . 
192 => he always sat on his special bench overlooking the harbour wall and he soon noticed my new interest in the place . 
193 => of course , he knew who i was . 
194 => everyone knew the school masters son . 
195 => i sat down beside old eric one day . 
196 => his nut brown old face held twinkling clear eyes , half hidden beneath thick bushy eyebrows . 
197 => years of sharp sea air had roughened his skin and made him swarthy . 
198 => he seemed as old and wise as neptune himself . 
199 => i sat there and wondered how many ships he had sailed in and how many lands he had seen . 
200 => he looked intently at me but i pretended to gaze out to sea . 
201 => what you say , boy ? 
202 => rasped old eric . 
203 => i ear you want tknow bout legends , and he laughed . 
204 => when he laughed , which was often , it was like the sound of a cackling crow , raucous and broken . 
205 => folks dont want tknow bout legends these days , boy . 
206 => theyre too busy , too young , too modern , too much of a hurry tunderstand legends , harry . 
207 => oh ! 
208 => but i really want to know , i insisted . 
209 => tell me about the olden days and the temple of the wind . 
210 => i looked at him earnestly and he caught my eye . 
211 => just for a moment i couldnt look away . 
212 => i felt i was being tested . 
213 => you got a while , boy ? 
214 => sit tight an ill tell you a tale . 
215 => he bent down close to me and looked at me fiercely . 
216 => but first you must swear that youll never repeat a word of it to any folk that dont live ere . 
217 => this is island lore , no big city stuff ere , boy . 
218 => his old fingers stabbed the air in the direction of the mainland and he lowered his voice to a hoarse whisper . 
219 => they must never know our secrets . 
220 => do you swear and promise , young un ? 
221 => yes , yes , i stammered . 
222 => i swear . 
223 => the hard , penetrating gaze of the old man scared me as i spoke . 
224 => then he turned away and looked out across the water and his story began . 
225 => a long time ago , they say , there lived an extraordinary man who came to suidhe . 
226 => he was a traveller and a magician a doin his magic for them that could pay . 
227 => the magician was a great tall man with white flowing hair and strange ways . 
228 => he had a large black cape hed wear to cover all . 
229 => he was an imposing figure . 
230 => stood out in the crowd , you might say . 
231 => he had bright eyes set in an old mans face . 
232 => he never walked slowly . 
233 => wherever he went , he took mighty strides like a man with a purpose on his mind . 
234 => some folk thought he was just an entertainer and that he played games with his magic . 
235 => others took im more seriously . 
236 => they had a name for im , although if it was his real name i couldnt say . 
237 => they called him mythras , after some ancient myth . 
238 => old eric took out his pipe and started to methodically stuff the bowl with tobacco as he continued his tale . 
239 => he stayed here a while and entertained the high folk and elders . 
240 => he cast spells to keep away vermin . 
241 => tis said mythras had magic water that could make people laugh or cry . 
242 => he talked about the stars and the planets and the earth . 
243 => but the one thing that folk wanted to see he kept hidden , except to the special few he chose . 
244 => he had a small wooden box : all inlaid it was , with mother of pearl carved in fancy patterns and magical signs . 
245 => he would say that he made the box himself from the wood of a special tree in a distant land . 
246 => inside the box he kept a massive gem stone . 
247 => the pale glassy crystal was magic and could change colour . 
248 => it seemed to glow as you looked into it . 
249 => the more you looked , the more you were drawn into it , like looking into your lovers eyes . 
250 => stories tell that once you had looked into that magic stone , you could never forget it . 
251 => it glowed and formed pictures in your mind , like the embers of a fire . 
252 => the crystal pictures filled your dreams with patterns and light that stretched back into the night . 
253 => the minister at chapel , at that time , was strict ; not like we have now . 
254 => he took a dislike to the magician and called him a charlatan and a bad man . 
255 => he made the folk believe the magician was evil and a fraud . 
256 => magic aint possible , he said . 
257 => folk was very superstitious and believin in those days and the magician was not made welcome any longer . 
258 => before long he packed his bag to leave . 
259 => mythras went to the harbour , right where we are now , to hire his passage to the mainland and the big city . 
260 => but none of the locals would take him ; they were scared of him . 
261 => the people got together and chased him to the edge of town and told him to magic himself away or wait for a boat with mainland folk to take him . 
262 => they told him not to come back into their town . 
263 => the magician stopped and turned on them and , in their turn , they stopped and faced him . 
264 => he looked magnificent with flowing beard and glowing eyes . 
265 => the children hid behind their mothers skirts . 
266 => the will of the men wavered as they felt his power . 
267 => magic or none , he was a strong man and his piercing eyes blazed at them . 
268 => then he spoke out in a grand voice saying : curse you all . 
269 => you have refused me passage and you treat me like a criminal , yet i have done you no harm . 
270 => i have helped you many times if you only knew it and this is how you repay me . 
271 => you call me a fraud , but now i cast a spell over you and you will see the truth of me . 
272 => none of you here will ever leave this island and live . 
273 => all of you present , to the smallest child will be held a captive of this place . 
274 => do not try to get away ; you will not succeed or you will die in the trying . 
275 => now leave me ; you will not see me again but you will remember me . 
276 => oh , yes ! 
277 => you will all remember me ! 
278 => so saying , he turned and walked on up the hill , leaving the islanders gaping and silent . 
279 => nobody moved : they were spellbound . 
280 => mythras made his way to the centre of the island and climbed sgurr-cavan to its summit . 
281 => he stood at that place silhouetted against the lurid sky and raised his hands to cast his spell over the whole island of suidhe . 
282 => almost at once , a great storm began to rise on the horizon and dark clouds filled the sky all around . 
283 => it got so dark it was like an eclipse . 
284 => a strange spinning wind came racing across the seas towards the island . 
285 => the islanders could hear it screeching like hundreds of wailing souls . 
286 => when the storm began , many ran for shelter , fearing the work of the devil . 
287 => the sky was black as night and lightning forked down like snakes tongues , so close folk could hear the hiss and crackle . 
288 => billowing clouds formed above as tension filled the air . 
289 => men ran down to the harbour to secure the boats . 
290 => then the rain began . 
291 => great heavy sheets of water swept across the harbour and lashed down as the strange dark vortex came closer . 
292 => a cry went up , its a tornado , take cover . 
293 => run , run , run for your lives ! 
294 => but the voice was lost in the screaming wind . 
295 => the whirling fountain of air seemed alive as it sucked up jets of seawater and consumed anything that fell into the swirling cauldron at its base . 
296 => fearing for their safety , the men abandoned the boats and struggled up to the chapel . 
297 => at that time it was the only stone building in the town . 
298 => the chapel bell was swinging wildly in the steeple and pealing out the disaster . 
299 => inside , the folk were gathered wondering and praying . 
300 => children screamed as the window glass blew in and tiles were ripped from the roof . 
301 => the noise was awful and the place seemed filled with a fearful madness . 
302 => outside , the tornado rushed across the island like a mad , wild thing , terrifying the animals , pulling at anything in its path . 
303 => they say that it went right to the summit of sgurr-cavan and plucked up the magician where he stood , placid , with arms raised , waiting . 
304 => in the chapel , the people found the minister cowering in a corner and whimpering pathetically . 
305 => all attempts to talk to him failed . 
306 => it is said , to this day , that in a storm , you can hear a man whimpering in the chapel , but tis most likely just the wind in a flue . 
307 => the storm died down as quickly as it had come . 
308 => folk tell that the winds were like the sound of ghosts laughing as they sped off to the horizon . 
309 => the island , and everything on it , was soaked by the heavy rain . 
310 => torrents had gouged ruts in the roads and swept away the bridge . 
311 => everywhere , trees were leaning over or had fallen across the paths . 
312 => broken boughs had crashed onto roofs . 
313 => the animals in the fields had broken through the fences and ran wildly and panic stricken from place to place . 
314 => worst of all , the boats in the harbour lay smashed , submerged or gaping . 
315 => splintered wood was strewn across the decks . 
316 => there was not a single craft left that could endure the dangerous journey to the mainland . 
317 => it seemed that the magician had exacted a terrible revenge on the islanders . 
318 => yet incredibly , except for the ordeal of the experience , and the downfallen minister , not one of the islanders had come to any real harm in the storm . 
319 => some of the elders , having satisfied themselves that everyone was well , sent a team of young men to salvage what they could from the harbour . 
320 => without boats for fishing they knew they would soon starve . 
321 => others were dispatched to attend to the old or young in their houses and to clear the town as best they could . 
322 => they knew it would be a long task and so it was . 
323 => many weeks passed before normality could return , and many years would pass before the curse was finally forgotten . 
324 => the next day , five men set out to climb to the top of sgurr-cavan to find what they could of the magician . 
325 => they hoped he would not be found , but they armed themselves in case of trouble . 
326 => as they got closer to sgurr-cavan the devastation increased . 
327 => the stunted trees and bushes had all been ripped away from the lower slopes . 
328 => close to the summit of the hill is a vast amphitheatre shaped corrie . 
329 => it is a fearsome place in a storm where the winds gather and rocks tumble . 
330 => here , the whirlwind had dumped its load of debris from across the island . 
331 => rocks , boulders , roof tiles , uprooted bushes , even wood from the boats in the harbour , were deposited like so much jetsam on a beach , yet it was the top of the hill . 
332 => at the centre of this bizarre and strange old place , they found a pillar of glimmering rock crystal as high as a man . 
333 => none of them had ever seen it before and none knew from where it had come . 
334 => some said it came out of the ocean . 
335 => others said it was the magician turned to stone . 
336 => but everything had changed there forever . 
337 => as good as his word , mythras had gone without trace . 
338 => he was never seen by any of the islanders again . 
339 => a long time passed , but the five men told no-one else of what they had seen on the hill . 
340 => the townsfolk were too busy repairing and rebuilding to be bothered . 
341 => the magician had gone : that was all that mattered . 
342 => during the weeks following the storm , nobody left the island . 
343 => the memory of what the magician had said was still fresh and folk were not keen to try to tempt fate again . 
344 => but the need to go to the mainland for supplies was urgent . 
345 => in those days , there was no ferry and the islanders had to fetch their own provisions . 
346 => usually , they sent a pair of boats each fortnight to take produce to market and bring back essentials . 
347 => the time had come to go to market and two boats had been salvaged and repaired . 
348 => each boat had a volunteer crew of two men : four of the men who had been to the top of the hill after the storm . 
349 => it was early morning and a perfect day for the journey . 
350 => the weather was fine and the sea was calm when they set sail for the mainland . 
351 => many of the island folk watched the little boats move off across the waters . 
352 => they felt happy that life was at last returning to normal , but a few of them also felt a little uneasy . 
353 => what about the curse of mythras ? 
354 => would the boats ever return or had the minister been right about the magician ? 
355 => storms , after all , were not unusual on the island , although no-one living then had ever seen a tornado there before . 
356 => the sailors were not expected to return until evening and it was late in the day before people began to gather on the harbour wall to await the boats . 
357 => the first star shone through the clear evening light as daylight faded and two sails approached the harbour walls . 
358 => there were exclamations of relief from the small crowd gathered on the wall . 
359 => the evening breeze blew the heavily laden boats briskly homewards . 
360 => it was not light enough to see into the boats as they neared the quay . 
361 => not until the last moment did anyone realise that something was wrong . 
362 => the boats came in , low in the water , weighed down with their cargo . 
363 => the sailors were surprised . 
364 => why hadnt the sails been dropped . 
365 => leaving it bit late , whats up with em ? 
366 => but the boats rode on straight into the harbour wall . 
367 => men scrambled down to help unload the boxes and crates only to discover that the crews had gone . 
368 => the boats were full of provisions but the four men had disappeared . 
369 => there was no sign of them , no clue to signify why they had vanished or how the boats had returned without crews . 
370 => there was nothing they could do but unload the supplies . 
371 => some days later , when a mainland boat arrived , enquiries were sent back to the big city , but came to nought . 
372 => the mystery was never solved , the men were never found . 
373 => from that time , the mainland crews brought the provisions and that was the beginning of the ferry . 
374 => time passed by and healed the wounds wrought by the great storm . 
375 => the islanders slowly forgot about their ordeal and mythras the magician . 
376 => there were , however , two other strange events that took place at about that time . 
377 => the first was known only to a few who had been to the top of sgurr-cavan and seen the pillar of crystal . 
378 => exactly one year after the storm , the strange pillar vanished . 
379 => no one knew where or how . 
380 => some time after , one dark night , the two boats , which had sailed home so mysteriously empty , also disappeared . 
381 => no-one recalls if the magicians curse came true . 
382 => generations passed and many years after all the folk who had witnessed the great storm had grown old and died , a new minister came to the island . 
383 => his name was reverend finder and he became interested in the history of the place . 
384 => he heard the old tales about mythras and the storm , just as i have told yer , and he became intrigued and started to investigate the mystery . 
385 => research he called it , but island folk didnt take to it . 
386 => his investigation didnt last long because he went missing whilst out walking one day but tis said he found the crystal , the white crystal of mythras . 
387 => a search was made but he wasnt found . 
388 => later on , the body of a man was found at the bottom of a ravine out by the western coast . 
389 => he appeared to have fallen and he was quite dead . 
390 => but he was not the reverend finder , nor anyone from the island . 
391 => most folk thought little of it . 
392 => they were not minded to believe in legends . 
393 => but tis said that the minister had set out to walk to the top of sgurr-cavan that day , which is many miles from the place where the body was found . 
394 => yet , there seemed to be some connection and some said that there had been foul play . 
395 => the mystery remained unsolved and now no one will ever know what happened . 
396 => we dont have any crime , nor any police to solve it here , see ? 
397 => the heavy scent of pipe tobacco faded and old eric tapped out his pipe on the heel of his boot . 
398 => he put the old briar back in his pocket before he spoke again . 
399 => now , young un , thats all i have to tell ee . 
400 => its getting late and im going to get my supper . 
401 => one last word from an old sailor whos seen a thing or two in his time : dont go meddling with the past . 
402 => folklore is for the old folk to tell ; its a story been passed down through generations and wheres the truth in it i couldnt say . 
403 => now harry , you run along and look to the future , not the past . 
404 => i wanted to speak , to say something . 
405 => i felt very excited inside but i could not find the right words to say . 
406 => my mind was too full of stories . 
407 => i was sure there must be something in what i had heard , something magical . 
408 => the old man slowly stood up and i followed . 
409 => thank you , i cried . 
410 => run along , then , he said and laughed . 
411 => just a story , harry , boy ! 
412 => i turned away and ran off up the street . 
413 => chapter two - chrissy the girl looked at the letter again . 
414 => she was a red headed teenager , tall with lively grey eyes . 
415 => she was always on the move , even when sitting : fidgeting , twisting , constantly picking up , putting down . 
416 => she wore old , dirty , shabby clothes : patched and faded jeans and a threadbare shirt . 
417 => the room in which she was sitting was also haphazard . 
418 => the old farm kitchen had hardly changed in a hundred years . 
419 => the furniture made from heavy , unpolished wood had a rough , time-worn appearance . 
420 => plates and dishes , ornaments and sundries covered the sideboard and table . 
421 => freeway and bess , the two labrador dogs , lay in a large wicker basket that was in front of the old cast iron range . 
422 => there they dozed , with heads lolling over their black and golden forepaws . 
423 => despite the wavering midsummer heat blowing in through the open window , the mica windows in the door of the range glowed red as the woody embers flickered , lazily casting shadows across the stone flagged floor . 
424 => the fire burned there every day , no matter what the weather , as it had for as long as anyone could remember . 
425 => old nails and hooks studded the blackened beams of the ceiling . 
426 => cooking pans , tools , implements , a string of onions , bags of herbs , tankards , leather belts , old horseshoes - a thousand items accumulated over many lifetimes , some used and some forgotten , awaiting their time , occupied the hooks . 
427 => this kitchen was the centre of farm life : meeting place , office , dining hall , surgery , occasional boarding house . 
428 => the old place was full to the rafters with memories and histories . 
429 => the lives of generations of farm families had been played out in the theatre of this room : comedies and tragedies , music hall and farce . 
430 => the echoes of those memories reverberated from the ancient walls . 
431 => it was late morning when a tall , thickset man with wild auburn hair and pallid skin , walked in through the open stable doorway . 
432 => he was the farmer and the father of the red headed girl . 
433 => he seemed weary and angry as he pulled off his worn out boots and left them sagging where they lay . 
434 => his shirt sleeves , rolled back to the elbows , revealed powerful arms and large hands with long , stained fingers . 
435 => he wiped the sweat from his brow with a large red handkerchief . 
436 => chrissy , his rough voice boomed , get us a tea , love . 
437 => he sat down heavily and leaned across the table . 
438 => the girl went to the range where a hot kettle stood black and steaming . 
439 => she refilled the pot and let it steep . 
440 => the room was silent for a minute , then she brought a mug of tea across the room and placed it on the grey boards beside him . 
441 => he looked up thoughtfully and opened his mouth to speak , but closed it again . 
442 => its okay , dad . 
443 => i read the letter . 
444 => itll be all right , i know it will . 
445 => wont it ? 
446 => her father looked up again and gripped the mug fiercely . 
447 => his eyes were alight with his anger . 
448 => its not okay , he shouted . 
449 => they have no right an i dont know what were going to do . 
450 => i never worked harder , but this is killing us and i cant do any more . 
451 => i can help . 
452 => you know i can help . 
453 => please let me help , pleaded chrissy . 
454 => no . 
455 => this is no place for you . 
456 => your mother an i have talked it all through . 
457 => we want you to go to your aunts house in the big city . 
458 => shell look after you until we settle up here and then ill find some place where we can be a family again . 
459 => her father looked straight at his daughter as he spoke , but his mind was full of the dam : the dam that held back his future life and left it empty and dry . 
460 => he could not understand how it had happened . 
461 => he never believed that it was possible until the day the river began to run dry and he had seen it with his own eyes . 
462 => now , the huge new reservoir on the hillside was full and the water , that had been his , filled the great steel pipeline that snaked across the plain to the big city . 
463 => how could they have stolen his water , his livelihood , and just left him there to starve with his loving wife and his beautiful daughter ? 
464 => the water company had offered to move him to a different place . 
465 => they had offered to buy the farm . 
466 => they had warned him that if the weather was dry he might run short , but he had never admitted the truth to himself . 
467 => he was too proud , too indignant , now he was hurting and his family was suffering . 
468 => he had dug a well but it was already dry . 
469 => he had wanted to sink a borehole but he couldnt afford it without his neighbours help and they had all taken the water companys money and gone . 
470 => he turned his bowed head and looked out through the dusty window . 
471 => the fields stretched wide across the plains towards the snowy mountains . 
472 => the farmhouse stood at the centre of the farm . 
473 => a ragged old track scratched across the surface of the fields , dustily tracing its way towards the road . 
474 => the farm lay at the farthest edge of the vast prairie called the heartland that stretched across the arid miles of featureless flat lands between the mountains and the sea . 
475 => the crows stalked in the fields , among the remains of the crops . 
476 => dirty grey trees stood skeletal and leafless on the plain . 
477 => dusty mounds and dykes showed where the ditches once ran with water . 
478 => the pond in the farmyard was almost empty . 
479 => a few inches of slimy green water buzzed with mosquitoes . 
480 => one sad duck stood on the bank looking quizzically down at the scraggy weeds . 
481 => all about and above the world was an intense , fire-like heat . 
482 => the sun seemed to fill the sky as it blazed down . 
483 => all creatures walked with bowed heads in that lethal light . 
484 => the blistered grey trunks of once elegant trees lined the edge of a distant field , and traced the path of the dried up river bed through this sorry place . 
485 => look outside , chrissy , just take a look . 
486 => i cant fill the river . 
487 => we have got to go now . 
488 => we cant wait till the rains come this year . 
489 => we wont last that long . 
490 => it might not rain for weeks an itll take more than rain before that river flows again . 
491 => you know whats happened . 
492 => when man goes meddling with nature it always ends in disaster . 
493 => theyve undone the balance , thats what theyve done . 
494 => chrissy could see the anger in his eyes but she wanted to stay . 
495 => but what about the farm , dad ? 
496 => you cant just leave it . 
497 => we cant sell it , love , its not worth a bean . 
498 => only a madman would come out here , to this . 
499 => the farmer waved his hands vaguely behind him . 
500 => he looked sullen . 
501 => the sound of movement pierced the walls , and the door to the parlour opened . 
502 => a woman sailed in , dressed in flowing blue . 
503 => her long black hair was tidy in a bun . 
504 => she wore a dark blue sash around her slim waist and a delicate gold brooch , in the shape of a fish , on her dress . 
505 => she walked across the room humming to herself , seemingly oblivious to the girl and the man already present . 
506 => the sad man looked up at his wife . 
507 => she was a beautiful woman and their love was great . 
508 => now , the crisis of their lives was proving too much for all of them . 
509 => she had shut out the truth . 
510 => she lived in a make-believe world , pretending that life would go on as normal . 
511 => she could not conceive of a time when they would have to leave her parents farm . 
512 => she had lived there all her life and her parents and grandparents had lived there before . 
513 => the generations reached back to the first settlers : one family , one farm . 
514 => he stood up and went over to the proud and serene woman , who was standing by the old , spotless sink where she was incongruously singing a sad song to a soft melody . 
515 => i love you dear , he said to her quietly . 
516 => listen to me , now . 
517 => chrissy must go soon . 
518 => i will take her out to the coach in a little while . 
519 => you must say good-bye . 
520 => his wife looked up then . 
521 => she turned to her daughter . 
522 => well , she gushed , you and i must get ready . 
523 => i will dress you for the journey . 
524 => i do hope you have a lovely holiday , darling , and by the time you come back we will have everything fixed . 
525 => chrissy looked at her mother and saw the tears in her eyes . 
526 => even now , her mother did not have the strength to face the truth . 
527 => they all knew that there would be no return to the farm . 
528 => the mother and daughter went silently upstairs . 
529 => they came down a while later carrying an old case . 
530 => a transformation had taken place and chrissy looked the essence of a country society girl . 
531 => she was at once older and younger than before , self possessed but vulnerable . 
532 => she had her hair arranged tidily and wore the best clothes she possessed . 
533 => standing side by side , mother and daughter presented a picture of pathos and beauty . 
534 => chrissy carried a bag containing all that she valued : her notebook , an old book of poems , a small wooden box with a carved lid and her favourite old togs . 
535 => on her dress , she wore her mothers treasured brooch . 
536 => outside , her father had their old car ready . 
537 => they seldom used the rusty black relic . 
538 => they had always gone about the area on horseback . 
539 => but now the horses were sold . 
540 => the cars old engine had been running for a few minutes and it smelt of hot oil as it idled in the yard . 
541 => the tyres were cracked and the leather seats creaked , but the car still worked : enough for one last journey to the highway . 
542 => he packed the bag in the boot and opened the door for his daughter . 
543 => chrissy started towards the car , but then she hesitated and looked back to the house and the silhouette of her mother standing at the open door . 
544 => suddenly , she turned and ran off . 
545 => chrissy ! 
546 => shouted her father . 
547 => but she kept running until she came to the bank of the old river , which now lay desolate and murky . 
548 => she stood and looked into the place and remembered a childhood of dreamy , sun soaked days when she had swum and splashed in the cool water . 
549 => all through the years she had walked by the banks of the river or waded through the clean clear waters . 
550 => through a dozen winters she had seen the icy beauty of that place . 
551 => remember me , she whispered . 
552 => remember my secret , river and good-bye . 
553 => she looked for just a minute longer , with tears welling behind her eyes , before returning to the car and climbing into the seat without a word . 
554 => her father shut the door and they set off down the lane . 
555 => chrissy looked back and waved to the disbelieving mother . 
556 => the old jalopy bumped up the track in a billowing cloud of dust and slowly weaved around the potholes towards the dirt road . 
557 => half an hour later , at the freeway , chrissys father waited to see his daughter onto the bus that would take her into the big city . 
558 => when the old grey coach came into view , he pressed an envelope into her hand and gave her a kiss . 
559 => thats for you . 
560 => your aunt will look after you . 
561 => take care on the journey and be sure to write . 
562 => remember we love you . 
563 => good-bye for now . 
564 => a minute later , he turned away as the bus faded into the heat haze . 
565 => his eyes were glistening as he climbed back into the old tattered car and turned it around towards the farm road . 
566 => beneath the noise of the car he felt the silence pressing in . 
567 => he turned on the radio for company but the words gave no relief . 
568 => ***** the journey to the big city was a long trip and chrissy felt uncomfortable in her fancy clothes . 
569 => she longed to arrive and to turn back into her true self but somehow she knew that she would never return to her old ways . 
570 => her aunt had visited the farm on two or three occasions when chrissy was very young . 
571 => they hardly knew each other . 
572 => she did not want to live with her aunt , not even for a short time . 
573 => chrissy had never been to the city before , but she was a smart girl and knew more about the ways of the world than her country life suggested . 
574 => all of lifes harsh realities were exposed on the farm : the births and deaths , good times and bad . 
575 => but even though crude and sometimes brutal , it was truthful . 
576 => she had seen much of life in the country , before the dam had spoilt it . 
577 => but all her friends had gone , one by one . 
578 => the village , two miles from the farm , had slowly emptied until it was nearly deserted . 
579 => the school had closed . 
580 => she knew she could not stay , but always hoped she would . 
581 => people were rare and treasured in the heartland . 
582 => it was not possible to pass someone by without stopping to speak with them . 
583 => the distance between folk drew them together . 
584 => the farmers shared their precious possessions and their time . 
585 => everybody had helped everybody until the end , but the disparate community split asunder and moved apart . 
586 => left alone , she read books whenever she could and escaped into other worlds , but it was not the same as before . 
587 => and now ? 
588 => now she was going too . 
589 => but sitting on the uncomfortable , grubby seat she felt that life was moving from reality into a new fiction . 
590 => the bus trundled on noisily and stop-by-stop the seats filled up with passengers . 
591 => chrissy was not shy . 
592 => she used to talk to everyone she saw . 
593 => in the country , on the farm , miles from anywhere , she had never once felt lonely or scared . 
594 => travelling towards the big city she was moving into a different world with a different order . 
595 => the people on the bus kept themselves to themselves . 
596 => she felt like an outsider looking in . 
597 => she saw each one pretending that the others were not visible . 
598 => they remained alone and aloof in their own little worlds . 
599 => in the loneliness of their eyes , she saw hints of desperation . 
600 => chrissy thought of her friends and for the first time in her life suddenly she too felt alone and scared . 
601 => the bus ground on and chrissy sighed ; she turned her head and looked out of the dusty windows . 
602 => the countryside gave way to scraggy hamlets and the hamlets turned into towns . 
603 => telegraph poles lined the verges and filled the sky with wires . 
604 => the road slowly filled with traffic : cars , lorries , bikes and buses roaring and rushing . 
605 => the wooden houses in the small neat towns led on to brick houses and blocks of flats . 
606 => there were pavements and side roads , streetlights and shops . 
607 => all the paraphernalia of urban life crowded down to the edge of the road . 
608 => people were everywhere : crossing the road , getting on and off the bus , shouting on the pavements , looking in the shops , waiting in their cars , smiling , laughing , crying , everywhere . 
609 => chrissy filled her eyes with the sights until her head ached . 
610 => the smell of exhaust stuck in her throat and made her feel ill 
611 => time seemed to have accelerated . 
612 => so much was going on and yet , oddly , it seemed that very little was happening , except bluff and fluster . 
613 => she felt she was looking in on a dream . 
614 => the brick houses gave way to concrete offices and apartments . 
615 => intersections , railways , enormous buildings all flowed past the growling bus as it wound its way to the very centre of the metropolis . 
616 => finally , it stopped amidst a fleet of identical buses all lined up on the oily grey tarmac at the terminus . 
617 => people jostled to get off and hurried away . 
618 => chrissy sat stunned and silent , unsure what to do next . 
619 => the driver turned . 
620 => hey , this is the end of the road for you , girl , he shouted down the bus . 
621 => aint you got a home to go to ? 
622 => she jerked up her head and her eyes were red and damp . 
623 => he looked again , he thought she might be crying . 
624 => this time he smiled . 
625 => oh . 
626 => okay . 
627 => let me help you , love . 
628 => where you going to ? 
629 => he asked her kindly . 
630 => chrissy showed her aunts address to the driver and he directed her to another bus . 
631 => you show this to the driver and hell tell you when to get off , he reassured her . 
632 => towards the end of the afternoon , chrissy arrived at her aunts apartment block . 
633 => she felt tired and shocked by the total change that surrounded her . 
634 => she was uncomfortable and embarrassed in her pretty but old fashioned country clothes . 
635 => noise and pain filled her head , and her throat was dry and sore . 
636 => she wanted more than anything to go to sleep and forget where she was . 
637 => her aunt , a slack looking woman slouching against the lamp post , was waiting for her as the bus lumbered to a halt . 
638 => chrissy knew , before she even greeted her , that they would never , could never , be friends . 
639 => hi , im jessica , said aunt jessica . 
640 => you call me jessie . 
641 => were going to have a grand time . 
642 => aunt jessica spoke in a smoky drawl that was incessantly punctuated by her drawing breath on a cigarette . 
643 => she wore scanty , casual city clothes intended for someone half her age . 
644 => aunt jessica talked unceasingly about anything that came into her head . 
645 => most of her conversation was monologue and meaningless . 
646 => the ways of the city were all important to her . 
647 => fashion was her purpose in life . 
648 => she looked her pretty niece critically up and down in a way that made chrissy hold her coat in tighter for protection . 
649 => youre so cute in that ol outfit . 
650 => i do believe youre a honey , dear , she purred in her gritty voice but didnt smile . 
651 => aunt jessie still leaned against the post , casually smoking her cigarette . 
652 => then she jerked her head and walked across , throwing down the cigarette stub on the pavement . 
653 => her jealousy of chrissys natural young beauty lay smouldering between them . 
654 => aunt jessicas flat was as gaudy as her clothes . 
655 => small rooms appeared smaller , overpowered by bright colours and oversize patterns . 
656 => ornaments and furnishings filled every wall and corner . 
657 => any clear space or room for reflection seemed to scare her . 
658 => the whole resembled a charity shop showroom and , like a shop , was never quite as clean as it should be . 
659 => there were no books to be seen . 
660 => aunt jessica never found time to read . 
661 => ***** two weeks later , the sun was setting across the city skyline . 
662 => as usual , chrissy was alone in the apartment , high up above the grimy , litter-strewn streets . 
663 => she knew that her aunt would not be back until the early hours and that when she did come back , she would probably bring another friend to visit . 
664 => chrissy would not be welcome . 
665 => she went to her room to get ready for bed but changed her mind and went instead to collect her handbag and go down on the street . 
666 => a walk would be good , she thought , and how she longed to stretch her legs across the miles as she used to do in the country . 
667 => down on the street , the dusty heat of a summer evening filled the air , stifling and slow . 
668 => people wandered , scuffing their feet on the hard pavement , too lazy to walk . 
669 => the sound of music mixed with the distant cacophony of traffic on the freeway and a thousand half-heard conversations that drifted from the open windows above . 
670 => chrissy decided to find the bay that she knew to be somewhere ahead of her . 
671 => although it was evening , the night never truly found its way onto the streets of the city . 
672 => the lights and constant living never stopped . 
673 => aunt jessica had warned her to take care on her own . 
674 => youre such a sweet little lamb , honey , an this city is just full of wolves , dear . 
675 => dont ever trust none of them , specially if theyre men ! 
676 => chrissy never felt scared on her own , only in the company of others ; she walked on . 
677 => traffic choked the main street outside but it was the best place to find her way . 
678 => chrissy had already discovered an essential feature of cities : they are always bigger on the ground than they appear to be . 
679 => few people walked in this place and even fewer walked for pleasure . 
680 => debris littered the pavements and the roads were ruled by traffic . 
681 => as they passed by , drivers clocked the young girl wearing her scruffy old clothes , walking briskly and erect towards some unknown destination , but they had forgotten her by the next junction . 
682 => she was just another pretty girl in a city full of them . 
683 => the big city was divided into districts and , unknown to her , chrissy had just crossed the boundary into the docklands district . 
684 => she was heading towards the sea and passed rows of tall warehouse buildings with blank windowless sides . 
685 => the main highway spun off at a tangent and she suddenly found herself on a large empty road . 
686 => a few speeding cars and trucks sped by in a gust of exhaust fumes . 
687 => the sound of their engines clattered and echoed against the grey buildings . 
688 => the sky was a strip of half-light above the hanging street lights . 
689 => no other living thing seemed to be about . 
690 => the road ended abruptly at a deserted but large intersection where a railway line ran embedded in the tarmac along the dockyard front . 
691 => ahead of her , chrissy could see the looming hulks of several large ships that lay tied up alongside the quay . 
692 => tall warehouses with covered loading bays and rusty metal clad walls stood opposite the ships . 
693 => trains of railway trucks waited in orderly rows . 
694 => gantries and cranes towered above all , bathed in the glare of orange sodium lights that shut out the night . 
695 => occasional trucks rounded the corner and crawled along the roadway into the distance . 
696 => there was little movement close by , although lights peered out from some of the ships moored at the quay . 
697 => all about her were steel hawsers , rusty machinery , crates and stacks of wooden pallets . 
698 => in the distance , men were busy : shouting , whistling , loading a large , dull , rusty red cargo ship . 
699 => the small plink and lap of water betrayed the sea , here becalmed within the docks . 
700 => chrissy turned and walked slowly up the quayside , away from the lights and the men , towards the open bay . 
701 => the darkness covered her as she followed the glistening steel rails that stretched along the centre of the road . 
702 => a short distance passed before she heard a low whistle from one of the buildings . 
703 => she turned but saw nothing . 
704 => perhaps she had imagined it . 
705 => a moment later there was another louder whistle from behind . 
706 => she walked ahead quickly and a shadow stepped silently out from the dark roadside and stood in her path . 
707 => heart pounding and tense chrissy stopped dead . 
708 => the shadow spoke in a strange slurred drawl . 
709 => who goes there ? 
710 => the voice questioned . 
711 => dont you know where you are ? 
712 => chrissy became aware of other shadows closing in around her , and found herself surrounded by half a dozen young men , all dressed in black . 
713 => they stood legs apart and menacingly silent . 
714 => terrified , she spun around to look . 
715 => a large truck turned the corner and drove towards them . 
716 => the boys blinked foolishly and ran off as suddenly as they had appeared ; melting into the shadows , each in a different direction . 
717 => chrissy ran too , heart thumping , into the side of the road and darted back towards the street lights and ships . 
718 => the truck slowed , but did not stop before it continued on its way . 
719 => chrissy ran on to the corner of the road to town . 
720 => there she turned , hands gripped tight but all was empty behind her . 
721 => she walked briskly , almost at a run , not daring to look back through the city streets but did not encounter any more strangers . 
722 => she found her way to her aunts apartment and let herself in and slammed the door behind her with a massive sigh . 
723 => her hands trembled with fear as she tried to lock it . 
724 => she went to bed but could not sleep . 
725 => her mind was filled by the shadows of blackness surrounding her . 
726 => much later , aunt jessica returned , drunk and alone , from a night in the city . 
727 => coming into chrissys room , she shouted , and wheres the sleeping beauty ? 
728 => you wait , just you wait the boys will get you soon enough . 
729 => then youll wish you were just a plain jane , instead of instead of what you are . 
730 => mirror , mirror , on the wall . 
731 => thought chrissy but pretended to be asleep . 
732 => before she had come to the city , she had never thought of herself as beautiful or attractive but now realised she was both . 
733 => the next day , her aunt announced that she was going on holiday to the seaside and that chrissy was to go with her . 
734 => chrissy did not know what to make of the idea but accepted that she could not stay in the big city alone . 
735 => she had become bored and lethargic in the apartment . 
736 => her aunt was rude and short tempered and not the least interested in tales of the countryside . 
737 => aunt jessica was critical of chrissys father for letting the situation on the farm get out of hand . 
738 => she spent much time congratulating herself for picking up the pieces . 
739 => chrissy had never met such a selfish person before and felt at once sad and annoyed by the arrogant woman who now ruled her life . 
740 => whenever jessica brought home a man chrissy was banned from sight . 
741 => chrissy was expected to look after herself and to do most of the work around the flat . 
742 => aunt jessica cooked a rudimentary convenience meal once a day , but lived on snacks and sweets the rest of the time . 
743 => the woman had no interests beyond beautifying herself and would spend hours soaking in a bath or sitting in her room applying layers of powders and cremes to her ageing face . 
744 => underneath the strata of artifice , aunt jessica had been attractive once , but now her beauty was wasted . 
745 => she painted her face so heavily that when she emerged dressed for the city she looked like a clown . 
746 => chrissy thought it was pathetic . 
747 => five days a week aunt jessica worked in an office in the city . 
748 => when she returned each evening she was always complaining about the people she worked with and the work she had to do . 
749 => you farm people just have no idea how hard it is to do a real job , she drawled between puffs as she smoked another cigarette . 
750 => when its pay-day im going to have a ball . 
751 => im broke , and you dont help any , my pretty . 
752 => costing me a fortune , you are , and thats no lie . 
753 => you didnt bring any extra money with you i suppose , did you , honey ? 
754 => and her voice took on a cajoling tenderness for a moment . 
755 => no , replied chrissy . 
756 => was i supposed to ? 
757 => i guess not , honey , mores the pity . 
758 => aunt jessica sighed . 
759 => chrissy began to despise the woman who had taken her in and trapped her . 
760 => she could not go back to the farm . 
761 => she did not have the money to return and her parents would not be able to support her even if she did return . 
762 => the situation was hopeless . 
763 => she became sullen and lazy as the summer wore on and the impending holiday drew ever closer . 
764 => one day chrissy asked , aunt jessie , wheres the river ? 
765 => her aunt stared at her strangely and then replied : there aint no river in this town , sweetheart . 
766 => but there must be . 
767 => my river , it comes here . 
768 => dont be daft , girl , aunt jessica said . 
769 => if there was a river id know about it . 
770 => ive lived here all my life . 
771 => anyway , your rivers dried up and you know it is , and so the conversation ended . 
772 => chrissy went out and about whenever she could , partly to escape the boring apartment and her disinterested aunt , and partly to explore the city . 
773 => she talked to people and , although she found no friends , she became a familiar sight in the area . 
774 => whenever she met someone new , she asked them about her river and always received a similar reply . 
775 => can you tell me where to find the river ? 
776 => she would say . 
777 => what river ? 
778 => no , dear , not here , no river in this city , would come the reply . 
779 => one day , she met an old lady sitting in the doorway to a block of flats . 
780 => she said hallo and chrissy asked : have you ever heard of a river in the big city ? 
781 => im looking for my river . 
782 => the old lady replied : the river , my dear . 
783 => well , well , well and bless me . 
784 => no one asked about that before . 
785 => no they didnt . 
786 => i dont know about your river , but i can tell you about my river . 
787 => oh yes , oh yes , my river runs right through this town , but you wont see it for looking . 
788 => no , my dear , its lost its way , you see , gone underground it has . 
789 => do you mean there is a river here ? 
790 => chrissy asked , with excited eyes shining . 
791 => thats what i said , my dear , but you wont find it no more . 
792 => its got lost you see , she repeated . 
793 => but how can a river get lost ? 
794 => as easy as you or me , and the old lady laughed . 
795 => the river used to run right through this town as proud as can be , a long , long time ago , mind you . 
796 => there was a shipyard down by the harbour , and boats and bridges . 
797 => it was a beautiful river with trees and parks . 
798 => then one day there was a great storm at sea which blocked the harbour with sand , you see . 
799 => the river came up and up and flooded over the docks and houses hereabouts . 
800 => well , the city fathers didnt know what to do so they called in this great engineer and he built a high sea wall right around the town . 
801 => its still there today . 
802 => and he built a canal for the river to run in , all the way to the sea , with locks and sluices and all . 
803 => the river still flooded , but a way back behind the city , in the great swamp at the edge of town , you know . 
804 => but where is it now ? 
805 => cried chrissy . 
806 => now , now , i was coming to that , my dear , said the old lady . 
807 => well all those years ago this was just a small city , you know . 
808 => a good place it was in those days . 
809 => but slowly they rebuilt it , bit by bit . 
810 => they knocked down all the old places and built on all the parks . 
811 => everything kept getting bigger . 
812 => they said it was getting better , but not for the likes of us . 
813 => you see , the rich folks moved out to the edge of town and had their parks an lovely places there . 
814 => but here , well look around , its full to bursting and ugly as death . 
815 => anyhows , as they built , they covered everything , even the river , until it got lost . 
816 => most folks round here dont even know weve got a river , but we have , its right below us ; nobody sees it now , it must be so sad . 
817 => thank you , thank you , cried chrissy . 
818 => i knew i was right . 
819 => i will find the river . 
820 => it can be our river and i will take you there . 
821 => we can go together . 
822 => oh , no . 
823 => im much too old now , said the old woman . 
824 => but you go and find it and when you do , be sure to come and tell me . 
825 => chrissy skipped away elated . 
826 => she would start searching straight away and she would start at the harbour . 
827 => the weeks passed by and the proposed holiday drew nearer . 
828 => aunt jessica was becoming more irritable as time went by . 
829 => one day she asked chrissy : hey , honey , do you really want to come on holiday ? 
830 => chrissy replied : arent you going to go ? 
831 => yes , angel , im going , but do you want to go ? 
832 => suddenly chrissy realised that aunt jessica didnt want her to go and for a moment thought that she would be able to go back to the farm . 
833 => you could stay here , honey , just for one week . 
834 => ill get some stuff in for you to eat . 
835 => youll love it , keeping house on your own . 
836 => i would think it a big favour , only we wont tell your folks . 
837 => okay , sweetie ? 
838 => so it was decided and two weeks later aunt jessica shut the door to the apartment and went down the stairs . 
839 => chrissy looked out of the window and saw her meet a man on the street . 
840 => they went off together . 
841 => it was the last time that chrissy ever saw her aunt jessica . 
842 => chrissy decided that she had to go back to the farm . 
843 => she could not continue to live with her aunt . 
844 => although her aunt had left a small amount of money , it was not enough to buy a ticket back home . 
845 => chrissy decided that she needed to meet some people to help her get back , but she did not know where to begin . 
846 => she went out after breakfast the next day and explored the area where she had seen the young men by the docks . 
847 => in the daylight it was just a busy working area . 
848 => there was no sign of any young men hanging around . 
849 => that evening , she went out again and retraced her steps past the dockyard cranes and warehouses . 
850 => she walked on into the shadows by the quay and again she heard the low whistle from a nearby building . 
851 => chapter three sgurr-cavan i raced up the hill to my home after old eric had told me his tale , wondering , all the way , what had become of the white crystal of mythras . 
852 => if the reverend finder had found it , perhaps it was still in the house or chapel . 
853 => i crept into the chapel and searched the place but i could not find any signs of the past that linked it with the legend ; i did not know it had been rebuilt . 
854 => i left the chapel and returned to my house where i looked around in all the rooms but still i found nothing . 
855 => upstairs in my room , i wondered where i might find a clue to the mystery . 
856 => i lay on my bed and looked at the ceiling . 
857 => suddenly , it struck me that the loft was the place to look . 
858 => it was full of old boxes and trunks . 
859 => it was possible to enter the loft through a tiny door at the top of a small , steep flight of stairs , on the upper landing . 
860 => i slid back the bolt , pushed open the door and crept inside . 
861 => there was a dim light from a skylight overhead . 
862 => all about there was dust and cobwebs . 
863 => old boxes lay scattered on the beams beside the grey , musty smelling planks that lined the passage . 
864 => the first box i pulled down to open sent an avalanche of dust into the air and i began to cough . 
865 => i crouched completely still . 
866 => i did not want anyone to know where i was , but there was no other sound in the house . 
867 => slowly , i opened box after box . 
868 => i found old games , clothes , toys , books ; all manner of strange and delightful things . 
869 => another time , i would have stopped to look more carefully at the old curios , but i had a purpose in mind , and repacked them all . 
870 => i had opened all the boxes i could find . 
871 => i was beginning to feel disappointed . 
872 => there was nothing there . 
873 => i went back to the door and was about to go out when i heard steps coming up to the attic door . 
874 => quickly , i went back into the loft and looked for a place to hide . 
875 => i managed to squeeze in behind the massive chimney and turn out the torch just as someone came into the loft . 
876 => it was my father . 
877 => harry . 
878 => is that you ? 
879 => he called out . 
880 => i decided to stay quiet . 
881 => he stayed for a moment and then went away , closing the loft behind him . 
882 => i heard the bolt slowly and noisily slide shut . 
883 => how stupid of me . 
884 => now i was stuck in the loft . 
885 => i looked around for a way out . 
886 => there was no other way . 
887 => returning to the chimney i sat down on an old board and there opposite me hidden under the eaves was an old box . 
888 => it was so embedded in cobwebs that it would have been invisible from any other angle . 
889 => it took ages to get the cobwebs off it . 
890 => i dragged it out under the skylight and saw that it had writing on the top . 
891 => i wiped away the dust and my heart missed a beat as i read : property of reverend w 
892 => l 
893 => finder a mottled brown label had the words neatly inscribed in an old fashioned script . 
894 => brown twine , which broke as i pulled it , held down the lid . 
895 => hardly able to contain my excitement , i quickly opened it . 
896 => the residue of camphor greeted me . 
897 => inside the box , i found old fashioned clothes , all carefully folded and wrapped in tissue . 
898 => beneath the clothes were pens , paper , books and map . 
899 => i looked at each in turn but found no object or information that could help me in my search for the white crystal . 
900 => dejectedly , i put back the contents of the box , except the map . 
901 => i opened the map and saw it was hand drawn . 
902 => it was not of the island at all but seemed to be a place with mountains . 
903 => across the mountain range was the name snowy mountains . 
904 => although i was sure i had heard of it before , i did not know where it was , but put the map in my pocket anyway . 
905 => then i returned the box , as well as i could , to its former position . 
906 => with no other option left i returned to the door and lifted the latch expecting it to be locked . 
907 => the door opened immediately . 
908 => my father had closed the bolt but then on a hunch immediately opened it again , just in case . 
909 => he guessed i was there . 
910 => i went down to my room , changed my dirty clothes and descended to the study where my father was sitting and reading . 
911 => who was the reverend finder ? 
912 => i asked . 
913 => well now , where did you hear of that name ? 
914 => my father replied , looking up from his journal . 
915 => there is a box in the attic with his name on it , i said simply . 
916 => there is , and long may it stay there . 
917 => tell me about him , i repeated my request . 
918 => my father put down the journal and bade me sit down ; then he began . 
919 => there isnt much to tell you about the man . 
920 => he lived here a long time ago . 
921 => apparently he lodged in this cottage while his intended house was being improved . 
922 => only he never went to live there , though , because he disappeared . 
923 => that old box is all his property that was left in the house . 
924 => for a long time , im told , it was left in his room in case he returned to collect it . 
925 => some reports say he couldnt stand the quiet here ; he was a big city man , you see , and went back . 
926 => another story says he fell in the old mine workings and never got found . 
927 => i dont know what happened to him but he did leave one clue , if youre interested . 
928 => theres an old book of his in the bookcase over there . 
929 => i read it once , a long time ago , but i dont recall what it contained . 
930 => i think it was a diary and other notes . 
931 => he was a bit of a disappointment really , only stayed a couple of months , barely started the job , you know . 
932 => so saying , he picked up his journal again and continued to read . 
933 => i quickly found the book , and i wondered why i had never noticed it before ; it was a very ordinary , small , cloth bound notebook . 
934 => i walked out of the room clutching my treasure . 
935 => as i passed the door i glimpsed my fathers reflection in the mirror . 
936 => he sat looking and smiling quizzically at me . 
937 => the words : rev . 
938 => w 
939 => l 
940 => finder - suidhe 1853 showed neatly on the faded blue cover . 
941 => i opened the book . 
942 => inside the cover were the words ego sum dominus temporis in brown ink . 
943 => a different hand had added : lead us into temptation ! 
944 => below . 
945 => i turned the page . 
946 => clearly , it was a diary starting from the day of the rev . 
947 => finders arrival on the island . 
948 => the initial entries were disappointing : matter of fact descriptions of his new life and the people he had met . 
949 => however , the entry for sunday 1st may contained a passage that excited me . 
950 => i read on . 
951 => sun 1st may 1853 today i have found an odd box hidden amongst a batch of old papers in the attic . 
952 => the box is beautifully carved , made from ebony and lined with scarlet velvet cloth . 
953 => the patterns upon each side and on the lid are very intricate and strange . 
954 => it is most unusual and precious . 
955 => inside the lid it has the letter m carved in gothic script . 
956 => i wonder what or whom m was and i wonder what he kept in such an intriguing box . 
957 => tue 3rd may 1853 the papers i found on sunday appear to be of little significance except for one small notebook . 
958 => the book contains a collection of notes concerned with the ways of a magician called mythras , who once came to this island . 
959 => whoever wrote the notebook seemed concerned about this man . 
960 => i wonder if the m on the box i found could have stood for mythras . 
961 => the notebook contained the description of just such a box . 
962 => if the box was the property of the magician , he may have used it to store a famous crystal or gem that he is reputed to have carried . 
963 => i wonder how it came to be here ? 
964 => thurs 5th may 1853 today , i received a visit from a local man - peter inchcape . 
965 => he represents the elders on the island who are , i believe , the island council . 
966 => he was most welcoming and offered his assistance should i require it . 
967 => i shewed him the old notebook and he read it with interest . 
968 => afterwards he related a long tale about mythras and a great storm . 
969 => a local legend , he called it . 
970 => he tells me the stories of mythras had once been popular on suidhe , but he knew of no proof for their authenticity . 
971 => i did not shew him the box . 
972 => sun 8th may 1853 my first sunday service here . 
973 => i was very nervous and the chapel was full to bursting , but all went well and i felt quite relieved and relaxed by the end . 
974 => afterwards , i went out for a long walk across the island . 
975 => this is a good place to be and i am very happy here . 
976 => fri 13th may 1853 the box i found in the attic is no longer empty ! 
977 => today i found a magnificent gemstone hidden in the chapel . 
978 => i can not be sure , of course , but i have placed it in the box , it seems appropriate . 
979 => the crystal box has been returned to its former glory ! 
980 => sunday 15th may 1853 peter inchcape and i walked and talked our way up to the top of the great hill , sgurr-cavan this afternoon . 
981 => the weather was very poor and we took shelter in a large cave that is near the top of the hill . 
982 => peter tells me that there are many such caves . 
983 => some of them are old mine workings and should be treated with caution . 
984 => he also told me of caves on the coast that can be reached by boat at high tide . 
985 => there are no maps of the island . 
986 => i think i might attempt to make one when i have time , like i did on the mainland when i was a curate . 
987 => tue 31st may 1853 today , i went to the other side of the island and found the old caves . 
988 => i took out a rowing boat and explored the farther openings . 
989 => the locals were much amused by my antics in the boat ! 
990 => one cave leads back a long way . 
991 => i had neither time nor tide to explore far but it appears to have passages and streams entering at the far end . 
992 => there are many bats in the higher parts . 
993 => fri 3rd june 1853 one local man at newbridge is greatly interested in my questions about mythras and the storm . 
994 => i believe he knows more than he tells of the old stories . 
995 => he has told me they are legends made up to tell the children , but my discovery of the crystal box suggests to me that there must be some truth in the tale . 
996 => i explained that my interest is historical and that i propose to write a history of the island . 
997 => he clearly did not share my enthusiasm for such a project . 
998 => sat 4th june 1853 a strange thing - on my walk today i felt i was being followed . 
999 => i couldnt be sure but on several occasions i thought i heard something behind me . 
1000 => every time i stopped to listen there was neither sound nor sight of a follower . 
1001 => as i came up the hill , i saw the newbridge man i spoke to yesterday looking around the chapel this morning . 
1002 => by the time i reached there he had gone . 
1003 => peter inchcape offered to help me in my researches and to introduce me to the local people i might not yet have met at chapel . 
1004 => he seems a good man and very knowledgeable . 
1005 => tue 7th june 1853 this is a beautiful place . 
1006 => i thank god for bringing me here . 
1007 => today i walked to the top of sgurr-cavan and observed the view for the first time . 
1008 => so often , a wreath of cloud shrouds the summit . 
1009 => the peak is so much loftier than all the rest 3,000ft at least i should think . 
1010 => almost all the ragged coast of this isle is visible from there . 
1011 => the distant sea sparkled under the sun . 
1012 => it has been a beautiful day . 
1013 => the coves around newbridge are hidden from view by high cliffs at this vantage point . 
1014 => i descended the far side a little way towards newbridge but as evening was approaching i turned back . 
1015 => again , i was aware of the follower all the way down the hill . 
1016 => thur 9th june 1853 i determined to catch the follower and discover his interest in my affairs . 
1017 => i first spoke to peter inchcape about the follower . 
1018 => he was inclined to dismiss it as fancy but became more serious as i persisted . 
1019 => he told me , you are new on this island , my friend . 
1020 => there are things that happen here we are not so proud to speak aloud . 
1021 => this is an isolated place and our ways may seem a little strange at first . 
1022 => of course , we welcome you to the community , but there are those here who would not welcome your enquiries . 
1023 => being cut off from the mainland , as we are , some folk see us as a good place to hide away from enquiring persons . 
1024 => in short , suidhe is a good place to hide and a good place to keep things hidden . 
1025 => somewhat surprised , i asked if he meant smugglers . 
1026 => maybe so , maybe not . 
1027 => i am just saying , give the people time to get to know you . 
1028 => do not be hasty in judgement . 
1029 => fri 10th june 1853 another fine day . 
1030 => this afternoon i have walked to the coast . 
1031 => i am getting to know this island well now . 
1032 => as usual , the follower was somewhere behind me . 
1033 => i have seen him ! 
1034 => after a mile or so on the coast path i struck off up a track that leads to sgurr-cavan . 
1035 => the track passes through a dense pine wood . 
1036 => i darted into a thicket of trees and moved quickly , turning about here and there until i felt sure i had lost him . 
1037 => then i went up into a ravine i had seen from the top of the hill and through which the footpath passes . 
1038 => this small ravine traps the sun and the heat was intense . 
1039 => many insects were buzzing about me and , more than once , i saw a snake slide across the rocks ahead . 
1040 => i crept along to the top of the steep valley and dropped down into an opening in the rock to wait . 
1041 => it is very wild and rocky in this part of the island and i was completely alone , except for my shadow . 
1042 => some minutes later the follower hastened up the path , unaware of my presence above him . 
1043 => i had intended to confront the man , until i saw him . 
1044 => i had suspected that man from newbridge who was so interested in my questions but the man i saw on the path was peter inchcape , my friend and adviser , or so i thought . 
1045 => a cold feeling came upon me and i felt very scared . 
1046 => i watched him pass and , when i was sure he was out of sight , i crept to the edge of the opening and stood on the ledge in the sunlight . 
1047 => suddenly , i saw the silhouette of a figure high above me looking into the ravine . 
1048 => he was staring straight at me . 
1049 => clearly , he could see me . 
1050 => the sun was behind him so i could not be certain who it was but it seems certain to be inchcape with that broad brimmed hat . 
1051 => i didnt know what to do . 
1052 => should i acknowledge him or go to him or turn and run or do nothing ? 
1053 => something made me turn away . 
1054 => i went back to the opening and felt a distinct cold draught of air issuing forth from deep within the cave . 
1055 => i walked a little way in and found myself in absolute darkness . 
1056 => it was the opposite of the ravine . 
1057 => i had moved from summer midday to cool midnight in a space of yards . 
1058 => the sound of distant water echoed about me , dripping eerily . 
1059 => the underground chill made me shiver . 
1060 => i was aware of a great space ahead of me that i could not see . 
1061 => the caves must have been deep and the passages large . 
1062 => immediately i thought of the caves on the coast and wondered if they were connected i shall have to investigate . 
1063 => the cool dark air cleared my thoughts . 
1064 => how stupid to be suspicious . 
1065 => peter inchcape had shewn me here in the first place . 
1066 => it was a beautiful day and only natural he should come out walking here as well . 
1067 => i decided to walk out and meet the follower , peter inchcape , after all . 
1068 => i walked out into the warmth and glare of the sunlight . 
1069 => there was no one visible . 
1070 => i called and received no reply but the echo of my own voice rebounding back across the rocky ravine . 
1071 => in the distance , i heard a strange wild bird call but i could not see the creature that uttered it . 
1072 => i turned and walked back home and this time i had no follower . 
1073 => i think there is a mystery here . 
1074 => it has some connection with the magician mythras and the story of the storm , but it also has something to do with the present day and the island elders . 
1075 => i do not yet know what connects these parts of the puzzle or why . 
1076 => tomorrow i shall go to the top of sgurr-cavan again and see if i can find where the crystal pillar is supposed to have stood - perhaps there is something to it . 
1077 => the caves seem to hold secrets also . 
1078 => ***** this was the last entry in the diary and left me wondering what became of the rev . 
1079 => finder and his mystery . 
1080 => i searched further through the books and papers in the parlour but found nothing in them to complete the story . 
1081 => however , by chance , i went on an errand , for my father , to the small island library . 
1082 => there i found the records of the suidhe chronicle , the island news sheet . 
1083 => there were many bound volumes and in one edition i found the following article . 
1084 => friday 17th june 1853 a search has failed to trace the whereabouts of the rev . 
1085 => w.l.finder ( aged 32 ) who disappeared whilst out walking on sunday . 
1086 => he was last seen walking in the direction of sgurr-cavan , in the early afternoon , by local man peter inchcape . 
1087 => no further sightings have been reported . 
1088 => a search party combed the area on monday , without success . 
1089 => these discoveries excited me greatly . 
1090 => it seemed to me that the rev . 
1091 => finder may have found the crystal and mythrass box . 
1092 => had he disappeared like the four sailors ? 
1093 => had some other adventure befallen him on that final sunday ? 
1094 => what was the importance of the caves on sgurr-cavan ? 
1095 => the next day , i visited my friend frank and persuaded him to come with me , to the temple of the winds , to search for the caves . 
1096 => we prepared for the adventure carefully . 
1097 => i packed a torch and a compass . 
1098 => despite the warm weather we knew it would be cool in the caves and we both packed warm clothes and plenty of provisions in our knapsacks . 
1099 => the climb to the centre of the island began early . 
1100 => it would be a long trek and we had promised to return before nightfall . 
1101 => i calculated that we had about twelve hours before sunset and it would take several hours walking each way to complete the journey . 
1102 => frank and i walked up the hill to the edge of oldford and crossed the old bridge across the head of the gorge that marked the path of the river . 
1103 => the river flowed through an opening in a low rock cliff that lay at the head of the gorge . 
1104 => the waters gathered above in the marshes and moors and found their way underground to this point . 
1105 => we made our way swiftly , at first , along the well-used paths and tracks that threaded around the many small fields and orchards that lay below the hills . 
1106 => several islanders , who were harvesting their crops of fruit and hops , waved to us as we passed . 
1107 => we had a jolly time and fresh apples to eat . 
1108 => walking along , i imagined how the rev . 
1109 => finder had probably trodden the same paths all those years ago . 
1110 => the weather was fine and , as the sun rose into the sky , the day became warm . 
1111 => the dew-soaked bracken , nettles and grass beside the paths slowly dried . 
1112 => as we looked out across the gently rising plain , we caught glimpses of the distant sea reflecting the blue skies . 
1113 => a refreshing sea breeze was blowing across the hillside and cooled us in the heat . 
1114 => four miles inland , the lush green that surrounded the farmsteads gave way to a rockier terrain . 
1115 => the seldom used paths thereabouts became harder to walk along . 
1116 => after an hour and a half of steady walking , we found ourselves at the foot of the central hills . 
1117 => we stopped there for refreshments and surveyed the scene from our vantage point above the fields . 
1118 => it was mid-morning as we started to climb the hillside . 
1119 => there were paths to follow but they often became indistinct as they wound across the rocky outcrops . 
1120 => the formation of the hills on the island was like a shelf full of books that had half fallen over on to their sides . 
1121 => alternate steep rocky escarpments and shallow rising pastures built up in a fairly orderly manner towards a central point . 
1122 => this area was the deer gardens , and a large herd of red deer roamed across the rocks and pastures there . 
1123 => sgurr-cavan , however , was a different formation and towered above in a craggy and haphazard fashion like a giant cairn of stone . 
1124 => the dense dark , almost black of gabbro , pierced the skies . 
1125 => sharp ragged silhouettes of rock buttresses erupted from the moors , surmounting the tawny , mellow and heather covered hues of the lower limestone slopes . 
1126 => even in the bright sun of a summers day , sgurr-cavan looked somehow cold and forbidding . 
1127 => some rock climbing was necessary to reach the top and careful footing was imperative . 
1128 => we circumnavigated each jutting outcrop through a series of steep ravines that led inevitably towards the central peak . 
1129 => runnels of loose stone and scree as sharp as glass covered the steep sides of the valleys . 
1130 => these deep fissures often contained narrow running streams that fairly galloped down the slopes as they gathered their forces before reaching the base of the hill where they drained into the peaty marshes above the coast . 
1131 => the valleys and rocks are home to goats and sheep in the summer months and we passed a few shepherds fire circles built in sheltered places . 
1132 => the higher we went the colder it became and we were glad of our warm jackets . 
1133 => like so many hills , when seen from a distance , sgurr-cavan was a larger and higher prospect in reality . 
1134 => the sun had passed its zenith by the time frank and i finally walked into the broad corrie below the knife edged ridge that ran up to the summit . 
1135 => the huge bowl shaped corrie was a bleak place of black and grey . 
1136 => waterfalls tumbled down the rocks to the centre . 
1137 => at that point there was a large flat topped rock around which five streams met and tumbled into a pool . 
1138 => this must have been where the crystal pillar had stood . 
1139 => climbing up to the top we were standing on a small level platform maybe ten feet across . 
1140 => a tiny cairn of loose rock , invisible from below , was assembled on the top . 
1141 => normally , it would be bad luck to disturb a cairn but i could not just leave it . 
1142 => we took the rocks apart to search for for what ? 
1143 => there was nothing there . 
1144 => carefully we rebuilt the cairn and dropped back down to the floor of the corrie . 
1145 => ten minutes of steep clambering up beside one of the streams brought us to the top . 
1146 => we were at once ecstatic and tired . 
1147 => there was just room to sit and steady ourselves from the unceasing wind . 
1148 => it was the first time either of us had reached the top , although we had often clambered around the lower slopes . 
1149 => the exhilaration of achieving the summit was superb . 
1150 => the temple of the wind , i shouted . 
1151 => in answer to my voice , the wind blew in even stronger gusts and with a salty freshness from the sea . 
1152 => in that exhilarated moment i made a wish upon the wind : i wish to go across the sea to find a perfect friend in the land of the big city . 
1153 => we stood for a while with flying hair and ruddy cheeks facing the cold blast , before moving on . 
1154 => up here , it was too cold , even in summer , to stay still for long . 
1155 => frank and i found a sheltered place close to the rocky path by which we had ascended . 
1156 => there we sat and ate a hearty lunch of bread rolls , cheese , meat and salad accompanied by a wholesome cordial . 
1157 => we both felt strong and happy . 
1158 => we could see all the world we knew from the top of the hill . 
1159 => the air was as clear as crystal and great distances shrank before our eyes . 
1160 => in the direction of the mainland , i could see the big city neatly laid out like a perspective map in the far distance . 
1161 => buildings reflected the sun with a million glass-eyed windows . 
1162 => some roads were visible as a web of dull black threads . 
1163 => the tangled maze of streets near the centre gave way to grid like suburbs on the outskirts . 
1164 => detail evaporated into the distance , where a smoky heat haze hovered in a pall of grimy cloud above the streets , but the impression was complete . 
1165 => my eye looked inexorably on and , for the first time , i could see beyond the big city to where the land lay in a great plain reaching for many miles inland . 
1166 => to my wonder , i could see beyond the plain to distant mountains . 
1167 => almost in the blur of the haze , but quite definite , i could make out the glimmer of snow caps glinting across the high ridges . 
1168 => it was a view i would never forget . 
1169 => after we had eaten we climbed once more to the summit . 
1170 => i followed the horizon around , past the sweep of the mainland bays , until i was facing the opposite direction . 
1171 => there the sea stretched , seemingly forever , and the horizon blended into the sky in a featureless azure arc . 
1172 => we had stood in silence , gazing , when i realised that time was pressing on . 
1173 => come on frank , i cried , we must find what we came for . 
1174 => if we can , he replied . 
1175 => i was sure that finders caves must be on the far side of the summit , towards newbridge . 
1176 => in that direction , the coast was much nearer and the sea caves tunnelled inland . 
1177 => we laboriously made our way down the far side of sgurr-cavan . 
1178 => it was difficult to pick out a path . 
1179 => the scree was dense and treacherous and there were no streams to follow on this side of the summit . 
1180 => there was no sign of any caves in the rocky terrain either . 
1181 => a little lower down there were some cliffs where waterfalls of scree tumbled down . 
1182 => it would be too dangerous to go there and i could not see how the rev . 
1183 => finder could have gone that way . 
1184 => we decided to descend below the cliffs to one side and try there . 
1185 => working our way around we scrambled and scraped our way down to the edge of the high moors from where it was possible to approach the base of the cliffs . 
1186 => there were many large boulders close to the far edge that offered shelter to what little vegetation grew there . 
1187 => stunted and gnarled old trees , no larger than bushes , cowered beside the dark rocks , in the shadow of the wind . 
1188 => tufts of grass and moss clutched at clefts and cracks between the stones . 
1189 => we found numerous small openings behind the trees . 
1190 => at each one we thought we had found the mouth of a cave , but each in succession proved to be little more than a deep depression in the rock . 
1191 => suddenly , frank shouted across from between two boulders a little way down the slope . 
1192 => in here , harry , i think i can hear water . 
1193 => i ran across and crawled into the small gap . 
1194 => the faint metallic chime of running water echoed up from deep below but nothing was visible . 
1195 => its a long way down , he said . 
1196 => there must be a cave here . 
1197 => i think weve found it ! 
1198 => i whispered . 
1199 => but how do we get in ? 
1200 => lets look around , i said there might be a way in lower down . 
1201 => clinging on to the edge of the slope i could feel my head lightening with the effect of vertigo . 
1202 => we began to climb down the hillside but the rocks were difficult to negotiate . 
1203 => scree and loose boulders covered the mountainous incline and rattled down in runnels beneath our feet . 
1204 => the further down we struggled , the harder it became to retain a foothold or handhold . 
1205 => i began to feel very unsafe . 
1206 => we must have been two hundred feet below the summit but the way into the cave still eluded us . 
1207 => lets go back up , shouted frank . 
1208 => this is no good . 
1209 => i dont think i can , this scree is too unstable . 
1210 => as i replied , frank trod on another loose boulder and lost his footing . 
1211 => he slid , tumbling down the hillside below me , surrounded by an avalanche of sharp grey grit . 
1212 => i lay flat against the ground as small rocks washed past me . 
1213 => looking down , i shouted to him . 
1214 => frank , frank , where are you ? 
1215 => but there was no reply . 
1216 => when the dust had settled , there was no sign of frank ; he had disappeared . 
1217 => i began to ease my way cautiously down , slowly , slowly , like a crab . 
1218 => suddenly i saw it , and as i saw it , frank stood up . 
1219 => the sliding scree had uncovered the entrance to a small cave and , miraculously , frank had dropped through into safety as the boulders bounded harmlessly by . 
1220 => seconds later , i stood beside my friend , who , despite his torn clothes , was unhurt . 
1221 => the cave entrance was small but opened out into a larger chamber . 
1222 => the sun shone into the mouth of the cave and gave enough light to see back a little way . 
1223 => we prepared to explore and i took out my torch . 
1224 => our progress into the tunnel was slow at first , while we became used to the darkness and the cool echoing shadows . 
1225 => i felt increasingly insecure in the deepening dark as we ventured out of sight of daylight . 
1226 => often , i glanced back into the velvet black behind us . 
1227 => when we spoke , it was in a low whisper , as if to avoid being overheard . 
1228 => the magic of the cave slowly overcame our fear . 
1229 => we entered a small passage that led towards the centre of the hill . 
1230 => the tunnel was dropping down all the while . 
1231 => the ancient walls had been carved from solid rock and i wondered if man or nature had made them . 
1232 => we could hear the clink and drip of water all about us , while in the distance , but coming ever closer , was the sound of a running stream . 
1233 => the passage twisted several times and seemed to be becoming smaller . 
1234 => the roof was so low that we had to stoop to continue along the tunnel . 
1235 => we did not feel lost , there was only one way to go and , after checking on the little compass , i found we were still heading towards the centre of the hill . 
1236 => the passage ended suddenly and we found ourselves standing in a gallery looking into a black void . 
1237 => the torch revealed the floor falling away below , mirroring the roof that curved above . 
1238 => the torch beam was too weak to illuminate the full extent of the cavern we had entered . 
1239 => we stood , awe-struck by the enormity of the hollow mountain we had discovered . 
1240 => the rock in the passageways had been dark and indistinct in colour and the walls of this cavern were the same . 
1241 => but all was not dark . 
1242 => high above us , a single shaft of sunlight blazed through a fissure in the roof . 
1243 => perhaps it was the very crack we had first looked through ourselves . 
1244 => the light beam pierced the blackness like a glowing rod and struck the further wall . 
1245 => i gasped as i saw the place . 
1246 => the wall was alive with radiance and colour . 
1247 => the light cascaded about it like a furnace of brilliant jewels . 
1248 => the dancing sparkling beams shone through a waterfall in myriad rainbows that reflected on the roof in rippling patterns cast by a large pool . 
1249 => it was beautiful , but the thing that grasped my mind was the wall behind the pool , for there , at the point where the rainbows ended , was a massive eruption of liquid clear white crystal . 
1250 => somewhere inside me i began to understand the mystery of mythras and the mountain . 
1251 => we had found the white crystal and it was magical . 
1252 => frank and i stood in the rocky gallery for a timeless moment , silently watching the display as it slowly changed . 
1253 => the light from the sun could only shine through the fissure for a short time each day , and only for a small number of days each year . 
1254 => we were privileged witnesses to a moving experience . 
1255 => the secret of the hill would not have come to light had we been there on another day or at a different time . 
1256 => it was easy to believe that some glorious fate had drawn us to the cavern . 
1257 => i felt sure that mythras must have known about this place and the light window . 
1258 => he must have come to the island to find this cave and to obtain his crystal . 
1259 => i decided to take some for myself . 
1260 => i would find out the secrets of mythras . 
1261 => i awoke from the surreal dream that surrounded me and turned to frank . 
1262 => i realised that time would cause the crystal to vanish as the light moved and i said in an excited whisper . 
1263 => we must hurry , before the light goes . 
1264 => i need the crystal . 
1265 => frank did not question my desire . 
1266 => with frank in the lead we crept down into the massive chamber and began to cross the floor towards our goal . 
1267 => part way across the cavern , my foot stepped on something loose on a rock . 
1268 => i shone my torch at the place and gasped involuntarily . 
1269 => lying at my feet were the disjointed bones of a human skeleton . 
1270 => i stooped and looked at the unfortunate victim . 
1271 => there were no features of the former corpse left , but lying in some sand close by it were some coins . 
1272 => i picked one up , the date on it was 1853 . 
1273 => i put the coin in my pocket . 
1274 => my mind was racing . 
1275 => could this be the last resting place of the reverend finder ? 
1276 => if so , then what had happened to lead him to his death ? 
1277 => i looked down at the skeleton again . 
1278 => the gaunt white arm lay stretched out and pointing towards the depths of the cavern . 
1279 => the empty eye sockets stared into my face . 
1280 => i stared back , transfixed by the vacant glare for a moment , before frank called me on . 
1281 => i put the thoughts out of my mind and crossed the rocks to where frank stood by the edge of the pool . 
1282 => the magic light was playing upon his face . 
1283 => for some reason i felt unable to tell him about the skeleton i had found . 
1284 => ill tell him later , i thought . 
1285 => to reach the crystal we had to cross the pool , there was no way to go around it . 
1286 => i knelt down and felt the icy water and shivered at the touch . 
1287 => the pool was long but narrow . 
1288 => the waterfall showered down into the centre and flowed sedately out at one end . 
1289 => away from the waterfall , the pool was completely clear and by carefully shining the torch we could see where the bottom shelved deeply around the waterfall but appeared to be shallow close to the edge . 
1290 => i will go , i said simply . 
1291 => you hold the rope . 
1292 => so saying , i took the rope out of my knapsack and frank uncoiled it while i took off my trousers , preparing to wade through the water . 
1293 => i tied the rope about my chest below my arms . 
1294 => we would take no risks here . 
1295 => i stepped gingerly into the pool and the shocking cold water covered my skin ; it was like plunging into snow . 
1296 => i could feel the smooth rock on the bare soles of my feet . 
1297 => i felt a thrill run through me as i waded around the pool . 
1298 => the spray of mist from the waterfall constantly bathed me and the water slowly rose up to my knees as i moved towards the crystal . 
1299 => the pool was deeper where the overflow drained out and the strength of the current surprised me . 
1300 => i stopped to brace myself against the flow before i ventured on . 
1301 => the approach to the cascade of crystal took longer than i had expected . 
1302 => the crystal extended under the water and the floor of the pool became angular and sharp with the facets of the remarkable stone . 
1303 => all about me , the light seemed to float and flutter . 
1304 => the crystal was so bright in the darkness that it was hard to look directly into it . 
1305 => i became illuminated by the rainbows and was able to touch the stone at last . 
1306 => i had hoped to find some loose pieces . 
1307 => the stone was impressively hard to the touch . 
1308 => it was as smooth and as sharp as glass but firmer and less brittle , like a clear flint . 
1309 => i could not find any broken stone and took out the small hammer that i had brought with me in my bag . 
1310 => i tested the sharp crystal with the blunt steel and a shower of electric blue sparks flew from the hammerhead . 
1311 => i chose a point where the broken stone would not , i hoped , fall into the water . 
1312 => i shielded my eyes with one arm and i struck the stone hard . 
1313 => the crack of the hammer was like a gunshot and echoed into reverberation . 
1314 => light scattered momentarily as a piece of the precious rock fell against me . 
1315 => suddenly , with a squealing rush dozens of black shadows flew frantically whirling and flapping past . 
1316 => my heart missed a beat . 
1317 => it was just bats disturbed by the sound . 
1318 => perhaps i should have taken it as an omen of the forces the stone would release . 
1319 => i picked up the piece that had broken off . 
1320 => the stone was cold , smooth and heavy . 
1321 => it had perfect flat edges . 
1322 => i laid it in my hand and looked at the glowing crystal . 
1323 => it fitted snugly in my palm . 
1324 => i could tell the light in the chamber was changing and fading fast . 
1325 => i placed the hammer and the crystal in my bag and closed it securely before turning to make my way back . 
1326 => in my excitement , i had forgotten the freezing water . 
1327 => my legs were so numb that i could not feel my feet at all and i could barely move . 
1328 => a moment passed when , in panic , i thought i was stuck in the cave . 
1329 => with a great effort , i started to walk like a slow awkward automaton towards the shore where frank patiently waited . 
1330 => i shouted to my companion to take up the slack and my small voice died in the vastness of the great chamber . 
1331 => the journey back to where frank was standing took a long time . 
1332 => my legs were not getting any warmer and i could feel my whole body shivering uncontrollably with the cold . 
1333 => suddenly a shadow blocked the shaft of light and the cave pitched into blackness . 
1334 => involuntarily , i looked up to where the window had been . 
1335 => as the light returned i saw dislodged stone and dust floating down into the cave through the receding beams of light . 
1336 => i felt an even deeper shiver pass through me . 
1337 => what was up there ? 
1338 => i was about twenty feet from the edge of the pool when the disaster struck . 
1339 => i couldnt feel my feet and i missed my footing completely , plunging over the edge of an underwater shelf . 
1340 => i lost balance and fell headlong into the icy cold darkness . 
1341 => frank called out , harry ! 
1342 => the freezing liquid rushed into my mouth and nose , and i felt my head plunge below the surface . 
1343 => in a shock of coldness , the icy water filled me up as my head struck the sharp rocky floor of the pool . 
1344 => ***** frank struggled with the rope . 
1345 => at first it would not move at all . 
1346 => only by clambering into the edge of the pool could he free the rope from the edge of the rocky shelf and pull me up above water . 
1347 => with a tremendous effort i was pulled to the edge . 
1348 => desperately , he dragged my cold , wet body out of the water . 
1349 => frank knelt with limbs shaking , not just from cold . 
1350 => wake up ! 
1351 => please wake up , i heard frank say in the distance . 
1352 => then his voice seemed to come nearer . 
1353 => i became aware that i was awakening , as though from a long deep dream . 
1354 => i felt tired and wanted to pull my bed covers over me and go back to sleep . 
1355 => i was so cold and my head ached . 
1356 => the world became clearer , but the half-darkness of the cave was a mystery to me . 
1357 => i did not understand where i was until i turned over at last and looked up at the fading shaft of light high up in the chamber . 
1358 => frank , i shouted feebly , are you all right ? 
1359 => somehow , i thought that frank had been in some trouble , but my confusion soon gave way to the reality of the cold . 
1360 => i raised myself slowly to my knees . 
1361 => frank supported me as i struggled to re-dress myself . 
1362 => i felt nauseous and strangely light headed . 
1363 => the realisation of my accident in the subterranean lake had infiltrated my numbed head and i felt angry with myself for falling . 
1364 => the shivering cold began to subside as i covered myself in every layer of clothing i had . 
1365 => my legs itched and ached with the distressing sensation of burning as the feeling returned . 
1366 => we lifted our packs and slowly , and painfully , retraced our steps , past the silent witness of the skeleton , to the cave entrance . 
1367 => with every step my head pounded and pain shot through my legs . 
1368 => outside at last , we blinked stupidly at each other . 
1369 => frank stared at my head and gasped . 
1370 => harry , your head . 
1371 => no , dont touch it . 
1372 => well have to clean it up later . 
1373 => the gash on my skull had left my hair matted with blood . 
1374 => i was so cold and shocked i had not even felt it . 
1375 => but in the late afternoon sun i felt the warmth at last and something inside me was deliriously happy . 
1376 => i could not help myself and to franks astonishment i laughed aloud as i felt a fresh new freedom enter my heart . 
1377 => the expedition had succeeded . 
1378 => we would both remember the magical underground kingdom of crystal light for the rest of our days . 
1379 => we both respected the memory and kept the secret forever . 
1380 => the exhilaration of the moment and the warmth of the sun relieved my pain . 
1381 => frank and i tumbled down the scree and landed in a rather ungainly fashion on firm ground . 
1382 => we no longer felt any danger . 
1383 => after our adventure in the cave the outside world seemed innocent and homely . 
1384 => i stood up and dusted myself down . 
1385 => suddenly , frank hissed and pointed up to the summit of sgurr-cavan . 
1386 => look , up there ! 
1387 => i looked up at the summit and glimpsed the silhouette of a man . 
1388 => he was standing darkly outlined against the horizon . 
1389 => he was a tall figure in a wide brimmed hat . 
1390 => i blinked and looked again but he had gone . 
1391 => who was that ? 
1392 => asked frank . 
1393 => the follower . 
1394 => lets go , i replied , almost silently , the shadow of the man remained framed in my mind and i felt that he was strangely familiar . 
1395 => we decided to return home quickly . 
1396 => as we walked , i wondered about the skeleton i had seen , and about the reverend finder . 
1397 => then my thoughts crossed to the follower and the man in the wide brimmed hat . 
1398 => the form of the silhouette stayed in my minds eye . 
1399 => was that the follower ? 
1400 => the journey down sgurr-cavan was uneventful . 
1401 => we were both tired , especially me , and stayed quiet for a time . 
1402 => when we spoke , it was of the past and other events . 
1403 => even though it was all that filled our minds , neither of us mentioned our adventure in the cave . 
1404 => we arrived back in oldford , i stopped at the gate to my house and turned to say good-bye to frank . 
1405 => harry , he said , i am going away . 
1406 => what ! 
1407 => i exclaimed . 
1408 => i didnt want to tell you , til today . 
1409 => why ? 
1410 => were going to the mainland to live . 
1411 => i knew it would be soon . 
1412 => were going next week . 
1413 => were going to look at the place tomorrow . 
1414 => good-bye then , i said rather stupidly , and .. 
1415 => and thanks , for today . 
1416 => frank turned and began to descend the hill as i watched from the gate . 
1417 => at the corner he turned and waved , smiling . 
1418 => the melancholy of the moment passed and i laughed again , rather weakly , waving back . 
1419 => good-bye , i called . 
1420 => good-bye , came the fading reply . 
1421 => frank turned the corner . 
1422 => it was to be years before i saw him on the island again . 
1423 => i walked up the old flagstone path and pushed at the half-open stable door . 
1424 => i strode into the kitchen . 
1425 => i must have looked a sight . 
1426 => my mother shrieked when she saw me but scolded me as i laughed . 
1427 => i told her some of the adventure but left out any reference to possible danger , or the skeleton . 
1428 => she scolded me again but seemed satisfied as she cleaned up my bruised and gashed head and took away the bedraggled clothes . 
1429 => i hid the precious white crystal and went to bed early . 
1430 => i suddenly felt overwhelmingly tired . 
1431 => climbing up the stairs i tumbled onto my bed and slept . 
1432 => it came as no surprise when i awoke with a severe chill and remained in bed for nearly a week . 
1433 => wild dreams infested my fever , and later my mother told me i babbled strange tales about crystal lights and caverns . 
1434 => i smiled meekly but said nothing . 
1435 => i did not like to leave the crystal where it might be found , and i carried it everywhere with me . 
1436 => i kept it in a small leather pouch in my pocket . 
1437 => i spent hours gazing into the strange and beautiful stone i had found . 
1438 => i wondered how i could unleash the magical power that i thought it possessed . 
1439 => sometimes , the crystal would catch the light and reflect a spectrum of colour . 
1440 => sometimes , i found myself staring into the stone and forgetting everything around me . 
1441 => i seemed to be drawn into the crystal like a waking dream and my head was filled by strange words spoken by an unknown voice : i live in the stone , a world still apart , my life unknown , the earth my heart . 
1442 => how many long years ever will be , mysterious traveller across the deep sea ? 
1443 => stand clear in the dawn , the master of time , enter the caverns revealing the crime . 
1444 => older than history , filled with strange light , touching cold mystery inside the deep night . 
1445 => my thoughts are your deeds , each vision my sight . 
1446 => my father told me that my friend frank had visited during my delirium to say good-bye and that his family had departed to their new house . 
1447 => i was saddened ; it was my first broken friendship . 
1448 => here , i thought you might like this , my father said and he handed me a wooden box . 
1449 => i remembered it after you asked about finder . 
1450 => it belonged to him , i believe . 
1451 => see it has an m carved on it . 
1452 => i am sure i dont know what m is for , but it looks very old where was it ? 
1453 => i asked in wonder as i held the precious casket and stared at the strange device inscribed on the lid . 
1454 => in the study , he replied . 
1455 => i used to keep paper clips in it , but i am sure you will find some better use for it . 
1456 => thank you , thank you , i exclaimed and took the box up to my room to examine it . 
1457 => i carefully laid the crystal in the box . 
1458 => now it seemed whole again . 
1459 => i also took the 1835 coin and cleaned it so it shone like new . 
1460 => i put that in the box as well . 
1461 => on the lid i looked at the carved m 
1462 => m is for mythras , i thought . 
1463 => the first day i ventured out of the house after my illness , i went downstairs as usual , but stopped short in the hall . 
1464 => there was a picture on the wall by the door . 
1465 => it was so familiar i had never really noticed it before . 
1466 => staring down from the picture was the silhouette of a man in a wide brimmed hat . 
1467 => i asked my father who was in the picture . 
1468 => thats an old man from the island . 
1469 => it came with the house . 
1470 => his name was inchcape , peter inchcape . 
1471 => i believe he was one of the elders , he replied . 
1472 => i shuddered involuntarily and put on my coat and hat before going to the quay to see the ferry come and go . 
1473 => the crystal was in my pocket as i sat down on the quayside . 
1474 => the good weather had passed and the overcast sky was heavy with rain . 
1475 => the clouds darkened by the minute and people went about their business grimly , not minding me . 
1476 => all the while , i sat in my buttoned up jacket and i turned the heavy leather pouch over and over in my pocket . 
1477 => the rain swept across the sea and obliterated the view . 
1478 => i stood and walked to the shelter of the sea wall and sat on a bench in a sheltering niche . 
1479 => the weather hammered down upon us and closed in about us , bringing thoughts to my mind of mythras and the storm . 
1480 => i loosened the stone in the leather pouch and held it tightly in my hand . 
1481 => the sharp , hard crystal filled my closed fist . 
1482 => i recited the strange words that i had found at the front of the rev . 
1483 => finders journal over and over like a mantra until the words ran into one another . 
1484 => ego sum dominus temporis ego sum dominus temporis ego sum dominus temporis ego sum dominus temporis i heard the words murmuring round inside my head like the sound of chanting monks . 
1485 => i found i was standing up . 
1486 => i do not know why i did so , but then i made my wish upon the stone and walked slowly along the sea wall to the ferry pier . 
1487 => the ferry was boarding and the passengers were walking swiftly up the steps through the ticket office to buy their tickets and board the boat . 
1488 => i stepped up to the end of the line . 
1489 => the rain was streaming down . 
1490 => my pulse was pounding in my ears as i approached the boat , yet nobody spoke to me . 
1491 => all the while i could hear the chant inside my mind . 
1492 => i walked into the ticket office and stopped behind the last passenger as he bought his ticket . 
1493 => still no one stopped me as i walked slowly through the booth and onto the boat itself . 
1494 => the ticket inspector took the ticket from each passenger as they passed him , tore it in two and returned half . 
1495 => i followed the queue and came up to the inspector . 
1496 => he took the ticket from the man ahead of me and just before i approached he turned aside and shouted up to the bridge . 
1497 => okay . 
1498 => thats the last . 
1499 => lets leave this storm behind . 
1500 => the engines took on a new clamour and deckhands began to remove the ropes holding the gangway . 
1501 => my heart was leaping as i turned and ran back down the gangway to the pier . 
1502 => the complete lack of shouts or commotion was unearthly . 
1503 => i stood absolutely still as the boat pulled away . 
1504 => i couldnt believe it . 
1505 => somehow , they didnt know i was there . 
1506 => something had changed ; i wasnt there . 
1507 => while i watched , a great black crow flew down and circled above my head . 
1508 => involuntarily , i took the old coin from my pocket and looked at it again . 
1509 => it shone brightly against the dark sky . 
1510 => i heard a strange flapping and saw a brief darkness above me . 
1511 => i put up my hand to shield my eyes from the huge crow as it swooped down upon me . 
1512 => the great bird grasped the coin and wrenched it from between my fingers before speeding away through the rain and across the sea . 
1513 => with a gasp , i stepped back to the edge of the wall and let go the stone in my pocket . 
1514 => i was feeling nauseous and faint . 
1515 => perhaps i was still unwell . 
1516 => i sat down on the bench in the niche again . 
1517 => i opened my eyes . 
1518 => i felt strangely sleepy , as though awakening from a dream . 
1519 => i looked up and saw .. 
1520 => but what was happening ? 
1521 => the ferry had just started boarding ! 
1522 => had i dozed off - was it just a dream ? 
1523 => i felt in my pocket - the coin was missing . 
1524 => the same passengers walked up the gang-plank as before . 
1525 => the ferry moved off and i sighed in relief . 
1526 => perhaps i should not have come out after all ? 
1527 => i must have fallen asleep . 
1528 => i stood up and walked quickly around the corner , straight into old eric . 
1529 => his firm bony hand clasped my shoulder tight and spun me around to face him only inches away . 
1530 => i could feel his rasping breath on my face . 
1531 => where you goin in such a hurry , boy ? 
1532 => no .. 
1533 => nowhere , i stuttered , stupidly . 
1534 => he looked at me steadily , the rain dripping off his hat and coat . 
1535 => you found that old crystal yet ? 
1536 => he asked in his gruff smoky rasp . 
1537 => no . 
1538 => what do you mean ? 
1539 => i lied . 
1540 => you know what i mean , boy , he laughed . 
1541 => where you been this week ? 
1542 => i missed my young friend , and he relaxed his grasp . 
1543 => ill in bed . 
1544 => ah ! 
1545 => an i thought you had disappeared into sgurr-cavan , he said and his eyes looked fiercely from under the brim of his old hat . 
1546 => look , i must be going . 
1547 => im late for breakfast , i shouted above the din of wind and rain . 
1548 => he drew me close and said . 
1549 => not so fast , lad . 
1550 => just you remember , them old stones are all temptation . 
1551 => they aint bad in themselves , mind . 
1552 => but i can tell ee , theyre old . 
1553 => they dont run to our laws , oh no . 
1554 => he pulled me closer still and stared into my eyes . 
1555 => i wanted to turn away but couldnt . 
1556 => and another thing , boy . 
1557 => them stones are only for here , for suidhe . 
1558 => they dont do nothing over there , and he pointed across the water as he spat the words out . 
1559 => always seek the truth , boy . 
1560 => you wont ever find them stones , but they might find you and if they do , dont tell a soul . 
1561 => no , dont even tell old eric . 
1562 => theres people on this island and elsewhere who can still remember the laws of the elders . 
1563 => they dont want any magicians here again . 
1564 => always seek the truth , boy . 
1565 => remember mythras lad . 
1566 => remember i tells you . 
1567 => he let go of my shoulder . 
1568 => but how does the crystal work ? 
1569 => i asked . 
1570 => another time boy , another time , he replied giving me a staring glance . 
1571 => here , he said , i found this at home . 
1572 => thought you might like it . 
1573 => he thrust a coin into my hand . 
1574 => i looked at it . 
1575 => the date on it was 1853 , just like the one i had found in the hill and so recently lost , only dull . 
1576 => i started to speak but he put his finger to his lips and said , not a word , boy . 
1577 => not a word . 
1578 => old eric turned to go . 
1579 => i watched the old sea dog walk along the quay into the wind and rain , and then i ran off up the hill to my home . 
1580 => chapter four - the double cross the ancient , stalwart house was as massive as a castle . 
1581 => cold stone floors echoed the sound of the thunder in rumbling peals through the great rooms . 
1582 => a torrential shower of rain obscured the view from the windows . 
1583 => high walls flared electric white as the lightning crackled past , close by . 
1584 => the storm had cut all power and the grey , monstrous building lay in shadow . 
1585 => mullioned windows , set high above the ground , pierced the stone walls . 
1586 => slate roofs stretched up into the gloom . 
1587 => shaggy masses of moss carpeted the tiles and old twining creepers fanned their fingers across the walls . 
1588 => the outlines of the turrets and towers were half-hidden by the mists and streaming rain . 
1589 => this eerie abode hugged the lower slopes of a tree covered hillside in the foothills of the snowy mountains . 
1590 => range upon range of ever higher hills , precipice upon precipice , piled up behind it . 
1591 => somewhere in the distance there were high , snow-covered peaks capped with icy white , even in the height of summer . 
1592 => the evening storm had driven inland across the plains and was rattling through the hills to mark the end of that long , hot summer . 
1593 => water filled the gullies and smoothed the cracked baked clay . 
1594 => the tired streams began to flow with brown , creamy , frothing liquid . 
1595 => the earth breathed and the sweet smell of rain-soaked soil smothered the fields . 
1596 => all around , the water released new perfumes from the pine woods where wild herbs scented the undergrowth . 
1597 => fungi mushroomed up overnight through the woody tilth . 
1598 => the creatures of the world took shelter in the woods , hedges and holes . 
1599 => the violence of the opening scene gave way to a gentler play . 
1600 => a new , softer rain caressed the countryside with its cooling feathery touch . 
1601 => life returned to the fields and forests ; brown turned to green . 
1602 => everywhere , leaves were dripping and the burnt umber of parched earth received the abundance in heaving sighs of gratitude . 
1603 => the hill farmers in their farmhouses slept with smiles upon their faces while , in their dreams , they fixed the plough and tilled the red ochre soil , or scythed the lush grass ready for the changing year to come . 
1604 => high on the hill , with the electric light restored , the old house seemed to cast a softer shadow than before . 
1605 => no sinister murk adorned the lofty towers . 
1606 => instead , the dull grey limestone was friendly and welcoming in the shower . 
1607 => the ages of time lay easily in the stones , even as the builder had intended , twenty generations before . 
1608 => this hilly place , was the source of the streams that fed the tributaries that led to the rivers that snaked through the plains . 
1609 => a wild world still ruled below the shadows of the mountains . 
1610 => wolves roamed the deep woods searching for lost sheep . 
1611 => bears hunted for the sweet honey from the bees nests and searched out quiet caves for their winter sleep . 
1612 => the rocks trembled here , from time to time , sending avalanches of scree washing down the valleys like dark chattering rivers of stone . 
1613 => the wilful rocks heaved while the mountain building continued . 
1614 => it was only possible to traverse the inhospitable snowy mountains for a few months each summer . 
1615 => the old drove road climbed through the great pass that wound its way up above the tree line , and snaked between the high peaks , where the air was thin and the eagle flew alone in the sky . 
1616 => there were no towns and few people in the mountains . 
1617 => here was the home of an ancient tribe hidden away in the remote valleys . 
1618 => the people were simple but tough . 
1619 => they farmed the sheep and goats on the hilly pastures below the tree line . 
1620 => the shepherds brought their sheep into the hills each spring and took them back to the lower valleys when late autumn approached . 
1621 => they were the only true people of the hills and lived solitary , almost silent lives . 
1622 => they moved from shelter to shelter , with their grazing sheep . 
1623 => the shepherds would rejoin their families in the winter , where they lived together in small hamlets in the foothills . 
1624 => erebos , the large house , built so long ago by a rich city man , lay at the edge of one of the shepherd hamlets . 
1625 => it was a summer palace for his escape . 
1626 => it had been empty and derelict for many years , a place where snakes and bears found shelter . 
1627 => one day , it took the interest of a man with the desire to live apart from other men . 
1628 => he was old but not yet tired . 
1629 => he had been a traveller for many years . 
1630 => he felt the need to seek out where nature held her power and , in that place , close to the mountains , he felt that something older than man still controlled the earth . 
1631 => this eccentric man ignored the shepherds and , in time , their mild curiosity waned . 
1632 => the people came to know him as the old man of the mountain but his true name , sicarius , was known only to him . 
1633 => when he needed a name he called himself dr 
1634 => wolfe . 
1635 => he lived there many years and gathered herbs in the woods and minerals in the valleys . 
1636 => he walked the hills and made charts and notes of all that he observed . 
1637 => this curious man filled the great house with his collections . 
1638 => he had the service of a number of short , swarthy strangers who had arrived from far away lands . 
1639 => they spoke in a foreign tongue and kept apart from all but themselves . 
1640 => every week , a cart brought supplies up the valley to provide for this small household . 
1641 => the small community survived unchanged for many years . 
1642 => occasionally , dr 
1643 => wolfe would go away , sometimes for months , and the house closed ; but he always returned . 
1644 => the few who saw him , remarked that he never appeared to be older and yet no one could place his age . 
1645 => he seemed to be a timeless man . 
1646 => the bleak outward appearance of the house was deceptive . 
1647 => the principal rooms were furnished comfortably , tastefully and with obvious expense . 
1648 => the suites of rooms on the upper floors were equally luxurious , with every modern contrivance available . 
1649 => why so many rooms were available for use , and yet remained empty , was a mystery to those who knew of their existence . 
1650 => dr 
1651 => wolfe ran his estate with methodical and perfectionist zeal . 
1652 => he maintained the buildings and land to an exceptional standard . 
1653 => within the lower floors of the great house there were secrets known only to one . 
1654 => many crates and packages filled the storerooms and vaults beneath the main building . 
1655 => shelves lined the walls of some rooms . 
1656 => there were rows of carefully labelled boxes stacked ceiling high . 
1657 => the labels were written in a strange language and coded with complex numbers . 
1658 => they concealed all they contained . 
1659 => the meticulous collector kept the doors to the rooms locked , unless he was present . 
1660 => erebos had foundations in the stone of the hills . 
1661 => behind the doors of the deepest vault was a wide passageway that led to a wall of solid rock , containing a doorway . 
1662 => within the stone arch , the door was made from a material with the appearance of stone and the smoothness of glass . 
1663 => there was no handle or lock apparent on the exterior surface ; the door opened by a hidden mechanism . 
1664 => beyond the door lay the workings of an old mine . 
1665 => the passageways hewn from the rock needed no support . 
1666 => the old man spent many hours behind that closed door , in the depths of the hill . 
1667 => a strange new symbol , a double-cross in silver on a green background , replaced the coats of arms that had once adorned the outside of the house and gates . 
1668 => the motto , which encircled the symbol , read ego sum dominus temporis . 
1669 => the same device marked every box and package in the stores . 
1670 => in the library , a complete shelf full of large leather bound books had the symbol tooled onto the spines and covers . 
1671 => every item of furniture and glassware , pottery , tools , cutlery and implement possessed the same identifying mark , either in ostentatious decoration or as a subtle insignia . 
1672 => the sign of the double-cross was all embracing within the walls of the estate . 
1673 => the morning after the storm , dr 
1674 => wolfe stood on the topmost tower of his great house and looked out across the world . 
1675 => the rain had washed clean the air and given it the clarity of crystal . 
1676 => on the horizon the morning sun caught the receding showers beneath the arc of a rainbow . 
1677 => dr 
1678 => wolfe wore a tattered cloak embroidered with the double-cross . 
1679 => his flowing white hair blew in the morning breeze , but the old face looked troubled . 
1680 => he seemed to be searching the far horizon for something . 
1681 => in one hand he held a long staff capped with silver ; in the other he held a box . 
1682 => a long time passed and he did not move but stood silently watching and waiting . 
1683 => a solitary black speck appeared on the horizon and moved swiftly towards the tower . 
1684 => the small black bird swept across the skies and grew into a great crow that landed upon the highest roof of the house . 
1685 => it looked down , with black eyes over a black beak , at the old man . 
1686 => the bird uttered a single broken croak and dropped something gleaming from its beak before it gathered itself up and flew off , back towards the horizon . 
1687 => dr 
1688 => wolfe turned to go and walked to the stairway . 
1689 => before he went down , he spoke quietly , but in a strong and steady voice . 
1690 => the time has come , at last , as he strided down the stairs . 
1691 => in the days that followed , the house became a place of great activity . 
1692 => servants prepared the guest rooms . 
1693 => they folded and stowed the dust sheets . 
1694 => transports arrived carrying supplies of food and drink . 
1695 => the small household expanded with the arrival of a dozen new helpers ; all appeared to be countrymen to the existing staff . 
1696 => the staff never talked while they were working . 
1697 => they remained mute until evening when , down in the hot kitchens , they babbled together in their strange tongue . 
1698 => it was clear that the house was being prepared for a number of guests , but the old man was not to be seen . 
1699 => he had made his way through the smooth stone door into the old mines . 
1700 => far above the house , on the hillside , acrid smoke rose up from unseen fissures . 
1701 => when all was ready , the old man stood in the courtyard at first light , and welcomed his guests . 
1702 => each one had journeyed separately . 
1703 => they arrived on foot from the forests and the hills . 
1704 => all had travelled for a great distance and appeared as dishevelled shepherds , wearing old grey cloaks over tough leather jerkins . 
1705 => dr 
1706 => wolfe stood at the gate as the first approached . 
1707 => welcome , he said with outstretched arm , it is indeed good to see you after such a long time . 
1708 => do come in . 
1709 => you are the first to arrive . 
1710 => dr 
1711 => wolfe , replied his guest , firmly shaking his hand , it has been a long journey and i am pleased to be here at last . 
1712 => there were six in all . 
1713 => five came at intervals during the day and slipped quietly through the gates . 
1714 => one arrived by dead of night , as the old man stood waiting by the ancient porch . 
1715 => he greeted each traveller in the same fashion as neither equal nor yet as their superior , but as one who stood apart , a civil host . 
1716 => the servants escorted them to their quarters . 
1717 => but all night a torch blazed by the door and the old man waited patiently for the one who would never come . 
1718 => dr 
1719 => wolfe and his guests assembled in the dining hall , at midday , for a meal . 
1720 => it was one week after the rains had begun . 
1721 => the scene was magnificent . 
1722 => pale light filtered in through the stained glass windows and spread coloured patterns across a table set for a banquet . 
1723 => the servants carried beautifully prepared dishes from the kitchens . 
1724 => waiters dressed in a handsome livery of blue and silver served the meal . 
1725 => the six guests sat opposite each other , three in a row , while the old man occupied the head of the table . 
1726 => there was an empty place laid at the foot of the table . 
1727 => the guests no longer wore country clothes but dressed in striking garments . 
1728 => each one was different in colour , but all were to the same design . 
1729 => they appeared very like the uniforms of generals from former generations , with embroidered waistcoats and coloured sashes . 
1730 => the six had transformed their unkempt hair and unshaven faces to emerge as strong , sophisticated , yet wise men : the lords of the double-cross . 
1731 => they were an ancient order who usually eschewed excess and finery in favour of research and philosophy . 
1732 => but occasionally they met in formal guise and pursued the work of the elders . 
1733 => the colour of the garments matched the titles of the lords : the blue lord of truth , the red lord of knowledge , the emerald lord of friendship , the purple lord of destiny , the violet lord of faith and the gold lord of freedom . 
1734 => dr 
1735 => wolfe wore white and he also dressed as a lord : the white lord of reason . 
1736 => there was one other , not with the company : mythras , the lord of mystery who had no colour . 
1737 => together , they made the strength of eight , the lords of the double-cross . 
1738 => they came from far and wide across the land , some from across the sea , where they , like dr 
1739 => wolfe , had studied the deeper arts of life and nature . 
1740 => the meal extended through the afternoon , with much conversation of travels , exploits and distant places . 
1741 => although they rarely met together the company seemed at ease and hearty as they withdrew to a parlour close by . 
1742 => there they indulged in beverages made from herbs and fruits from the mountains enhanced with spices from distant lands . 
1743 => the usually silent old man , their host , had become animated and lively . 
1744 => a long time passed in convivial conversation before the old man stood up , glass in hand , and spoke to them all . 
1745 => my friends , i have asked you here with a purpose in my mind , his voice became serious and slow . 
1746 => it is the time for us to act . 
1747 => i fear the white crystal has been found . 
1748 => the assembled six attended earnestly as the old man continued . 
1749 => we know of one who holds the knowledge and the fact of the white crystal , it is no longer a legend to him . 
1750 => we are not purveyors of magic or suspicion . 
1751 => yet it seems that the science of this thing acts just as a magic . 
1752 => it is beyond our understanding and so it is a dangerous thing . 
1753 => the one who has this crystal undoubtedly believes in magic , undoubtedly thinks he is the master of it . 
1754 => now , he has tried the magic and succeeded where others have failed . 
1755 => he thinks he has discovered the secret of this stone ! 
1756 => we can not leave him to use this power alone , and his voice rose as he spoke . 
1757 => it is too dangerous , for him and for us . 
1758 => we must bring him here and the white crystal must be safe guarded . 
1759 => nobody else may know of this thing or the balance of our world will surely be undone ! 
1760 => he thundered . 
1761 => the company murmured together uneasily . 
1762 => the six lords looked towards their silent companion who stood before them , quiet now , in grim contemplation . 
1763 => the white lord continued : we only know who we are and how to live because we have a place in time . 
1764 => but what of mythras , for we need his guidance in this mystery ? 
1765 => the blue lord stepped forward and spoke in a deep and measured voice . 
1766 => i , too , have news which i bring from the council of the elders . 
1767 => mythras is dead and the elders have elected you , if it is your wish , the white lord , the lord of reason , to take his place , to be mythras the lord of mystery , from this day . 
1768 => i bring with me the token of that office . 
1769 => the blue lord stood back in line with the others and waited for dr 
1770 => wolfe to speak . 
1771 => such things come but once in a lifetime . 
1772 => the elders in their wisdom have chosen wisely . 
1773 => i accept the office from this moment . 
1774 => tell them that dr 
1775 => wolfe returns thanks and i take the token of office into my safe keeping . 
1776 => mythras is dead and yet he lives . 
1777 => the blue lord handed a small wooden box with the symbol of the double-cross inlaid on the lid . 
1778 => dr 
1779 => wolfe held the box and spoke again to issue the first order of his new authority . 
1780 => now it is i who must take the matter forward . 
1781 => we must all prepare to journey again . 
1782 => go to your rooms and we will meet together in one hour in the chamber of the moon . 
1783 => at the appointed time , the seven gathered in a small chamber high in a tower . 
1784 => it was no ordinary room but painted deep blue with wide windows on seven of the eight walls . 
1785 => they sat around an old octagonal table and dr 
1786 => wolfe spoke . 
1787 => i will tell you now , something of the history behind this thing , he said , so you may decide with me on our path into the future . 
1788 => long ago , the council of the elders appointed one as mythras who was not worthy . 
1789 => he was a necromancer and very wise , but within , he was rotten with ambition . 
1790 => this man had become mythras by virtue of his great knowledge of the mysteries , which were undoubted and also because he claimed to have found a new science , the secret of temporal change . 
1791 => simply put , the power over time itself . 
1792 => the council of the elders foresaw that if he could indeed control time , he would also be very powerful and possibly dangerous . 
1793 => that is why they appointed him to be mythras , in order that he would be bound by the rule of the lords of the double-cross to always serve them and to preserve the good of our world . 
1794 => they devised the strength of eight to ensure that others would always be aware of mythras and his activities . 
1795 => they had no certainty of whether the mysteries claimed by mythras were true and the records showed they thought it unlikely to be more than a magicians trick . 
1796 => the council also saw that the power which mythras had claimed could be used for good as well as for evil , and should it be true , they desired to have the use of that science for their own ends . 
1797 => the council commanded the lords of the double-cross to watch mythras and to discover if he did possess the secret , as he had insisted . 
1798 => mythras had determined that there was a science to the illusion of temporal change and that a particular material could be manufactured that would create the effect he desired . 
1799 => in this i think he was correct . 
1800 => however , although he knew the formula for his magic , he did not possess the substance . 
1801 => he journeyed through all the known world and tested every material he could find . 
1802 => he built a laboratory and tried to create the perfect substance from the raw materials around him . 
1803 => he used cauldrons of molten lava collected from active volcanoes and distilled pure substances from precious stones , but all to no avail . 
1804 => the science of the world was many centuries behind his thought and his attempts to synthesise the substance were in vain . 
1805 => what exactly do you mean by temporal change ? 
1806 => asked the blue lord . 
1807 => we do not know for sure - but the effect was to change the pace of time . 
1808 => clocks could be made to work forwards or backwards , or not at all . 
1809 => this may have seemed a trick at first , but to those who experienced it , the effect proved very real and unbalancing . 
1810 => with such events , many things become possible . 
1811 => the seemingly impossible can be attained . 
1812 => replied dr 
1813 => wolfe . 
1814 => there was a tremor of excitement in his usually controlled voice . 
1815 => did this man ever succeed in his quest ? 
1816 => asked the gold lord . 
1817 => i have always believed that he did , although it has never been proven , thus our dilemma . 
1818 => we only have accounts of a travelling magician , accounts handed down over many generations and , no doubt , much altered and embroidered across the years . 
1819 => he was a pioneer and many pioneers have perished at the hands of their science . 
1820 => indeed , if he did succeed , he may have entered an impossible circumstance and perished . 
1821 => he necessarily worked alone . 
1822 => he claimed the material he required was a specialised crystal , a kind of timing master , which could not be synthesised from earthly materials . 
1823 => but he gave no hint where or how it might be found . 
1824 => in these days we use quartz crystals to regulate time , so maybe there is a clue in that . 
1825 => but he fell from favour . 
1826 => the council of the elders eventually stripped the man of his office . 
1827 => the records show that the council felt he could not achieve his claim at that time and he was outcast as a charlatan . 
1828 => the man went journeying and became a travelling magician , little more than an entertainer . 
1829 => however , the council did not trust him and always sent a follower after him , wisely as it turned out . 
1830 => many years passed and the travelling magician eventually went to the island named suidhe , off the coast from the big city and it was there that he disappeared . 
1831 => did he never re-appear ? 
1832 => the blue lord questioned . 
1833 => the magician never re-appeared in the same guise . 
1834 => but years later an old and very wealthy man died on the mainland . 
1835 => amongst his possessions , which were many and had been gathered from all the known world , and some of the world not then known , was this house . 
1836 => it was left in his will to the leader of the council of the elders . 
1837 => the will still exists and i have seen it . 
1838 => the paragraph relating to this house had a note attached which was addressed specifically to the council and stated , in a very rambling fashion , that the house contained the thing that the council had looked for all through the years . 
1839 => in short , it was inferred , the magic crystal was here . 
1840 => if the magic stone was found , asked the emerald lord , then why do you now believe it has fallen into other hands ? 
1841 => has it been stolen ? 
1842 => no . 
1843 => the white crystal was never found in this house . 
1844 => it has never been in our possession , but we do believe that it is the thing we thought . 
1845 => indeed , according to the will , there was more than one white crystal ; there were eight , one for each of us . 
1846 => for many years i have searched for the white crystals and the knowledge of the power they supposedly possess . 
1847 => in this i have failed , but i have also tried to find the formula of the material in question . 
1848 => it seems , however , that the ability to explicate the science contained in the stones died with the old man . 
1849 => a lifetime of search and research has failed to reveal any method of temporal change . 
1850 => it is , after all , illogical . 
1851 => but much that seems illogical can be found in nature . 
1852 => until we understand it , it appears as magic . 
1853 => our forbears had no understanding of electricity , or lightning or magnetism or the elements of science . 
1854 => they explained them with myths and imagination . 
1855 => whole religions would be devised to explain the circumstances of our world and our place within it . 
1856 => such knowledge can be hard to shift and legend can be mistaken for truth . 
1857 => i prefer the fact of research and the understanding of science . 
1858 => through this i know that the magician did not make these crystals , he found them . 
1859 => where did the magician find the white crystal ? 
1860 => asked the red lord . 
1861 => that we do not know in certainty , replied dr 
1862 => wolfe . 
1863 => we believe that the crystals were found somewhere on suidhe , where the magician disappeared . 
1864 => indeed , we believe that they are the key to his disappearance . 
1865 => but , alas , despite our many enquiries and searches on the island we have never found the source , if indeed there is one . 
1866 => i have looked there myself . 
1867 => the history of those days has become legend and unreliable . 
1868 => the clues that might have led us to the place were all lost or destroyed in a great storm . 
1869 => then the great war led to many years of darkness and the elders were obliged to move their attentions elsewhere . 
1870 => what is it that now makes you sure that a white crystal has been found ? 
1871 => questioned the gold lord . 
1872 => there is still one man on the island who remembers something of the elder days and who helps us from time to time , replied dr 
1873 => wolfe . 
1874 => he tells us that there is a boy on the island who has made a discovery recently . 
1875 => he believes the discovery is the crystal . 
1876 => if the boy stays on the island we can be sure of controlling this thing . 
1877 => but it is just a short journey to the big city . 
1878 => a teenage boy is vulnerable to many temptations . 
1879 => we must find the boy quickly and be sure of his safety , for you know that there are others in the world , with ambitions for power , who would wish to find him . 
1880 => the gold lord looked up . 
1881 => what others ? 
1882 => he asked . 
1883 => i inferred before that there are people out there with strong and strange belief . 
1884 => they are fanatic and claim these things for their own . 
1885 => they are dangerous and evasive . 
1886 => they are descended from the original follower sent by the council . 
1887 => if the white crystal is found we must determine from whence it came and then protect it for the sake of future generations . 
1888 => we must protect the boy and keep the others at bay . 
1889 => the ancient and the modern will play upon the fields of time before we are through with this , unless i am much mistaken . 
1890 => so saying , dr 
1891 => wolfe turned to the gold lord and gave him some papers tied in a scroll . 
1892 => these maps and papers will help you to find the boy from the island . 
1893 => you must leave by first light and seek him . 
1894 => choose one other to accompany you and make your preparations . 
1895 => the gold lord chose to take the emerald lord on the mission . 
1896 => they both left the room and returned to their chambers for the night . 
1897 => the violet lord and the purple lord will return to the council of the elders and inform them of what has come to pass this day . 
1898 => you will also inform the council that we will take action to safeguard the secrets known only to us . 
1899 => we must protect ourselves and all our people . 
1900 => there will be danger until the boy is secure . 
1901 => without speaking , the purple lord and the violet lord turned together and prepared to leave the great house . 
1902 => within the hour , the two men had again appeared in the courtyard . 
1903 => they were dressed in grey brown coats and dark leather hats . 
1904 => they would pass as common travellers . 
1905 => they walked through the gates , turned from the path and separated . 
1906 => they soon vanished in the mists that hung in hazy vaporous curtains across the valleys . 
1907 => there is one other duty , said dr 
1908 => wolfe , which is perhaps the most dangerous duty to perform . 
1909 => he turned to the remaining two lords and looked at them , silently , for a moment . 
1910 => what is the duty ? 
1911 => asked the red lord . 
1912 => you must go and find the others of whom we spoke , replied dr 
1913 => wolfe . 
1914 => those others who would also seek the white crystal . 
1915 => it will not be easy and we do not wish to alert them . 
1916 => they are ruthless men . 
1917 => look for three . 
1918 => two are the paid thugs but the third is the key . 
1919 => he will be harder to find . 
1920 => i do not think they will yet know of our concerns but they know about the boy . 
1921 => they , too , have their informants and they will be sure to be looking for this person . 
1922 => you must go from here and divert their gaze until we have time to secure the future for us all . 
1923 => are you willing to do this ? 
1924 => we are ready , the lords replied . 
1925 => but what of you , dr 
1926 => wolfe ? 
1927 => what of the white lord ? 
1928 => what of mythras ? 
1929 => i will remain here , there are other tasks to perform . 
1930 => so far , the omens are good and we thank you , so saying dr 
1931 => wolfe placed his hands on the shoulders of the other men ; then he turned and left the room . 
1932 => the night passed and , before the sun had cast the first shadows of the day , the red lord and the blue lord left the house . 
1933 => they slipped silently away , unseen , into the woods , each going his own way towards the future . 
1934 => they would travel to the place where other powers lived : the big city . 
1935 => before they left , dr 
1936 => wolfe bade them farewell and gave them each a small book of verses . 
1937 => often in our order , words have provided solutions when all else fails . 
1938 => these lines will be of use to you in times of trouble , they come from the elder days , he said . 
1939 => read them when you can . 
1940 => the old man of the mountain , dr 
1941 => wolfe , the white lord of reason who had become mythras , lord of mystery , stood steeped in thought and silence . 
1942 => after his companions had left he went into the library and consulted many old books , making notes and drawing diagrams . 
1943 => he finished his tasks and took refreshment before he walked down to the cellars and approached the stone door . 
1944 => the door swung open and , from within the dark passages , coolness filtered out . 
1945 => dr 
1946 => wolfe entered the tunnel and the door closed behind him . 
1947 => he turned on a string of lights that illuminated a long narrow passageway through the mountain . 
1948 => the old man strode forward and , after a short distance , the passageway curved sharply to the right and downhill . 
1949 => the sense of direction was soon lost as the tunnel spiralled further and deeper down . 
1950 => the coolness of the upper galleries gave way to an acrid , uncomfortable smell that pervaded everywhere below . 
1951 => the rock walls changed colour from light brown to grey to a metallic deep magenta . 
1952 => dr 
1953 => wolfe walked on steadily , his footsteps echoing as he descended . 
1954 => there was another noise ; it slowly became louder . 
1955 => it was a deep muffled pumping sound . 
1956 => the passage had , by this time , dropped far below the base of the mountain and the spiral tunnel eventually ended at a second door . 
1957 => the door opened ahead of the old man and he entered a cavern . 
1958 => a livid red glow leapt out from within . 
1959 => in this chamber , the deep slow pulse was all pervasive and , coupled to the high hiss of escaping steam , it sounded like a giant , slow steam engine . 
1960 => dr 
1961 => wolfe moved forward across the sweltering space . 
1962 => it was the size and shape of a small ship . 
1963 => the smell of sulphur hung in the air and small clouds of steam issued vaporously from hidden vents . 
1964 => the cavern was not empty : all about lay irregular masses of globular rock . 
1965 => to one side there were pipes , presses , chimneys and workbenches gathered around a laboratory . 
1966 => in places , great rock pillars stretched up to the roof ; ledges and platforms jutted out from the walls and at the centre there was a monstrous pit . 
1967 => it was from this fissure that the red glow emerged and it was to this point that dr 
1968 => wolfe threaded his way . 
1969 => the centre of the cavern was intensely hot . 
1970 => dr 
1971 => wolfe reached the edge of the chasm and stood on a high rock , which was carved to look like a giant lectern that overhung the cauldron . 
1972 => he looked down into the opening . 
1973 => the glare of molten rock reflected on his white robes . 
1974 => this was the reason for the house built on the mountain . 
1975 => this was the forge that the first owner had hoped would yield the magic of temporal change , a heat with the strength to melt rock , to totally destroy and to make anew . 
1976 => the tumult within the furnace was loud and the molten rock was boiling , leaping up and crashing back through the crusty red surface . 
1977 => dr 
1978 => wolfe noted that the lava was more active than he had seen it before , too active . 
1979 => he turned to leave ; there could be no experiments that day . 
1980 => swiftly , he made his way back across the chamber and through the door . 
1981 => just as the door was closing , he heard and felt the blast of an explosion from within the chamber . 
1982 => he dropped to the floor as the mighty rock door slammed shut behind him . 
1983 => beneath his feet he felt a faint tremor in the rock and , for the first time in his life , dr 
1984 => wolfe was scared . 
1985 => he was a powerful man amongst men , but to the powers contained within the earth , men are insignificant . 
1986 => the substance of rock and energy , that is the core of the planet , is part of a greater scheme of things : it is a part of the cosmos . 
1987 => quickly , dr 
1988 => wolfe returned along the passageway to the house and sealed the great stone door . 
1989 => outside he stopped and drew breath . 
1990 => even the earth seemed to sense the time for change was at hand . 
1991 => there were no further tremors that day and dr 
1992 => wolfe contented himself with planning for the future . 
1993 => the future at that moment seemed uncertain , but the thought of the six wise lords moving towards their allotted places filled his mind with hope . 
1994 => dr 
1995 => wolfe sat in his library surrounded by the shelves of ancient books . 
1996 => two cats , one black , one white , lay curled up on chairs , one at each end of the room . 
1997 => on the table beside him was a well thumbed volume . 
1998 => it was a hand written journal . 
1999 => he opened it to a marked page and read the words again . 
2000 => a day will come when i , mythras , will return . 
2001 => many signs will portend that day . 
2002 => do not look for me . 
2003 => i will find you all through the white crystal . 
2004 => he closed the book and said , mythras , the ancient fool ! 
2005 => he picked up the small wooden box he had received from the elders of the double-cross upon his investiture . 
2006 => he placed it on the table . 
2007 => he unlocked the casket with an intricate brass key and lifted the lid . 
2008 => inside , there was a miniature scroll , a gold badge and a sealed letter ; all inscribed with the double-cross . 
2009 => he took the letter and unfolded the crisp vellum paper . 
2010 => the letter read : to dr 
2011 => wolfe , the white lord of the double-cross , at erebos , mythras has passed away and it is time to elect a new lord to this honour . 
2012 => into your hands we have placed the key and into your hands we place the trust of the elders of the council . 
2013 => you will henceforth carry the name mythras , the lord of mystery , to all those in our company . 
2014 => you shall nominate a new white lord to join the double-cross and complete the strength of eight . 
2015 => you will maintain our secrets at all times and pursue our aims with vigour . 
2016 => the council will provide the means to carry out your task . 
2017 => once a year , or at our bidding , you will sit with us in council to undertake the business of the company . 
2018 => we welcome you , mythras - lord of mystery . 
2019 => signed this 21st elder day the chief elder of the council of elders of the company of the double-cross . 
2020 => dr 
2021 => wolfe poured himself a glass of claret and a thin smile played upon the his lips as he closed the casket . 
2022 => he allowed himself a small laugh and sat back in satisfaction . 
2023 => he saw further than others of his company . 
2024 => all the long years of work and study were at an end . 
2025 => the inevitable would come to pass : a future that even now was drawing near . 
2026 => his time had come and his patience , the years of waiting and watching , had been rewarded . 
2027 => he picked up a coin from the table and looked at it closely . 
2028 => the date inscribed on the coin was 1853 . 
2029 => i will not make the mistakes of my infamous predecessor , he said aloud . 
2030 => the cats stirred and eyed their master . 
2031 => i , sicarius mythras , will achieve my ambition . 
2032 => he spoke the words quietly , firmly and with a taint of menace . 
2033 => chapter five the big city the clock ticked loudly in my room . 
2034 => i went to bed but i could not sleep . 
2035 => i threw the bedclothes off and lay there , staring wide-eyed into the darkness . 
2036 => i got up and paced about the room . 
2037 => often , i went over to the window and looked out across the sea towards the mainland . 
2038 => i opened the window wider to try and catch a breeze , but the air was still and heavy . 
2039 => a storm was rising in the distance ; rain would soon be coming . 
2040 => clouds veiled the far away coast that i so wanted to see . 
2041 => three times i went to bed and three times i rose again . 
2042 => i felt excited . 
2043 => i had a feeling inside me that i had never experienced before : a half nervous tension , a strange smiling power , deep within , that made me tremble with exhilaration . 
2044 => i imagined myself walking on the water , over the sea to the mainland . 
2045 => time appeared to have stopped that night , as i walked around the small room . 
2046 => the clock moved so slowly . 
2047 => my mind was racing and thoughts flashed into my head even as the lightning and a distant rumble filtered through the window . 
2048 => the curtains fluttered in the breeze that heralded the storm to come . 
2049 => the tense clouds seemed to infiltrate my feelings and in a flash i decided : i will go . 
2050 => i went to the cupboard and pulled out my old duffel bag . 
2051 => i stopped ; what should i take ? 
2052 => in a few minutes i had filled it with warm clothes from the drawer and some biscuits from the kitchen . 
2053 => the first drops of heavy rain sputtered onto the glass as i crept silently back to my room . 
2054 => i went to bed for the fourth time that night . 
2055 => the sound of thunder reverberated in my ears but i did not listen . 
2056 => i felt satisfied and calm and this time i slept . 
2057 => i awoke at five oclock in the morning . 
2058 => the air was clear but everything outside was heavy with the nights rain . 
2059 => excited and scared , i was determined to go through with my plan . 
2060 => the day was the third of september , a saturday morning . 
2061 => the boat will be less crowded on a weekend , i thought . 
2062 => quickly and quietly , i dressed and put all the money i had , not much , into my wallet and collected my things . 
2063 => then , i wrote a quick note to my father : gone out on an adventure , back before bedtime , and placed it on the mantelpiece in the dining room , before going quietly back upstairs . 
2064 => i crept out of the window and jumped to the rocky bank behind the house where i landed silently on the soggy wet moss . 
2065 => i knew that no one else would be awake to see me . 
2066 => the early morning outside was cool , fresh and beautiful . 
2067 => the dawn was rising , and the clouds were rosy over the horizon , as i walked swiftly down the deserted street . 
2068 => the harbour , too , was still empty and quiet . 
2069 => it was almost high tide and the full grey sea was rolling slowly along the base of the harbour wall . 
2070 => a few gulls rode lazily on the waves : a flotilla of grey and white with black marble eyes that watched me as i passed . 
2071 => the old harbour walls , built from boulders and rough hewn stone , sat squat , heavy and strong . 
2072 => i did not know what i was going to do but was sure that something would get me to the mainland . 
2073 => i found a place to hide away in one of the niches and settled down to wait . 
2074 => i had determined not to hold the white crystal until i needed to board the boat . 
2075 => i was confident i would succeed . 
2076 => fresh banks of clouds slid silently across the dome of the sky and shut out the beautiful delicate pale blue . 
2077 => a new morning replaced the old : it was grey and damp with a hint of autumn in the air , carried on a cooling breeze . 
2078 => the peace of the island was all around me as i sat in the stony alcove beneath the harbour wall . 
2079 => looking about me , i listened ; all was quiet except the slow slosh of the sea and the sound of the wind in my ears . 
2080 => the excitement and danger that i had felt when i woke up had dissipated and in its place i felt calm , even happy . 
2081 => i realised , sitting there and determined to leave , that this island was my true home and a good place to live . 
2082 => i felt the emotion of belonging holding me to the island like a strange magnetism . 
2083 => an hour passed , during which time the harbour slowly came to life . 
2084 => men came to work . 
2085 => i could hear them , familiar voices , as they prepared the landing stage for the ferry . 
2086 => across the waves , the as yet unseen boat was approaching from the mainland . 
2087 => one of the men saw me sitting by the wall and waved to me . 
2088 => i was a part of the scenery now and people expected me to be there . 
2089 => i waved back while the hand in my pocket fingered the pouch holding the precious stone . 
2090 => i continued my vigil and , in the distance , i caught sight of a solitary figure . 
2091 => he was standing close by the empty old house that perches on the cliffs high on the hill , above the far side of the harbour . 
2092 => he stood very still , looking down at the boats and i wondered who he was . 
2093 => was he looking at me ? 
2094 => i looked down at the sea and saw the ferry come into view through the harbour entrance . 
2095 => the rusty black hull ploughed through the water leaving a white foamy wash rippling across the slow murky waves . 
2096 => black exhaust stained the air above the short stubby red funnel as the captain manoeuvred his vessel up the channel between the swinging buoys . 
2097 => the thrubbing of the ferrys engines grew louder as the small ship rounded the harbour wall and drew up alongside the quay . 
2098 => the engines revved roughly in reverse and the water surged around the hull . 
2099 => men called out and secured the ropes to bollards on the quayside . 
2100 => gently , the boat eased in to a rest , the engines stopped and the harbour was quiet again . 
2101 => saturday was a rest day and only a trickle of passengers crossed from the ferry to the landing stage . 
2102 => i counted six men in all . 
2103 => the dock workers were busy for an hour afterwards , unloading the grey sacks of post and pallets of cargo onto waiting trailers . 
2104 => when the hold was empty they began to stow the boat with crates of fish , farm produce and other parcels destined for the big city . 
2105 => the weather had turned foul and the dark clouds had blanketed the sky into a repressive gloom . 
2106 => rain poured down punctuated by the sound of more thunder rolling in across the sea . 
2107 => a handful of passengers had arrived to board the ferry and they stood sheltering from the teeming rain in a small shelter on the dock . 
2108 => i recognised them all and took care to remain out of sight . 
2109 => i waited until the crew raised the boarding sign and the first passengers went through the small wooden ticket office and up the gangway onto the deck . 
2110 => by now the quayside was almost deserted . 
2111 => the incessant rain swept in squally pulses across the docks . 
2112 => the shelter of the alcove was ineffectual and i was soon dripping and cold . 
2113 => i could not see any crew or passengers looking out from the boat . 
2114 => if i was to get on board , i would have to act now . 
2115 => i slipped the crystal from its leather pouch and into the palm of my hand . 
2116 => i repeated the same spell as before . 
2117 => ego sum dominus temporis . 
2118 => three times i said it and the same strange , sleepy , drugged feeling came over me . 
2119 => i picked up my duffel bag and moved out into the gloom of the day . 
2120 => i could feel my brow prickly and flushed with sweat as i stepped on to the quayside . 
2121 => i was trembling as i walked towards the ticket office . 
2122 => hail and rain poured in torrents . 
2123 => the sky was a mass of dark boiling cloud . 
2124 => it was strangely dark , even for a stormy day . 
2125 => i reached a spot a few yards from the barrier . 
2126 => i stopped . 
2127 => i could not move . 
2128 => the thunder was all around the town . 
2129 => the final passenger had already boarded ahead of me . 
2130 => my head felt heavy but looking up i could see several passengers and crew looking out straight at me . 
2131 => my nerve was shattered . 
2132 => i was shivering and about to turn and run away . 
2133 => suddenly , there was rending explosion . 
2134 => the air crackled with white heat as the lightning struck . 
2135 => the air filled with steam . 
2136 => i was deaf . 
2137 => i was blind . 
2138 => i could feel my whole body vibrate and hum . 
2139 => i think i may have screamed . 
2140 => my head pounded . 
2141 => i was overtaken by a dark panic as all thought left me and i ran and ran straight ahead . 
2142 => some vision returned . 
2143 => i could see again , just shadows , as i rushed towards the vessel . 
2144 => distant muffled sound echoed in my ears . 
2145 => someone on deck was shouting . 
2146 => people in the saloon were crowded round the windows looking out to where i had been standing just seconds before . 
2147 => i ran straight past the ticket office just as two officers from the ship crashed down the gangway and out to the quay . 
2148 => i did not stop . 
2149 => i ran on and up until i was out on deck , hoarse and shivering with shock . 
2150 => the rain streamed down my face and filled my eyes . 
2151 => i was alone . 
2152 => my shaking hands could barely grip the deck rail as i turned and looked back to the quayside . 
2153 => the two ships officers were bending over something on the quay and others were running across from the town . 
2154 => it looked like a body lying on the ground . 
2155 => for a long time nothing happened . 
2156 => then some of the men stood away and were earnestly talking as i stared out through the gloom . 
2157 => the two officers returned slowly towards the ferry as more people came from the town . 
2158 => another flash of lightning drew my eyes to the hills where the sharp silhouette of a figure stood in the storm . 
2159 => i shrank back under a gangway on deck where there was shelter amongst ropes and canvas . 
2160 => suddenly , i felt impossibly tired . 
2161 => i sat down on an old tarpaulin and closed my eyes . 
2162 => when i first opened my eyes , i panicked . 
2163 => i was nowhere . 
2164 => everything was white . 
2165 => perhaps i was dead . 
2166 => no , this was the boat , the ferry . 
2167 => this was where i had sat down . 
2168 => it was all right . 
2169 => i was stiff and cold but crawled out of my hiding place . 
2170 => clouds encircled the boat and everything seemed close and vague in the fog . 
2171 => it was a wet , murky dream world where reality had disappeared . 
2172 => i felt completely alone and the only sounds were the muffled grumble of the engines and the screeching of the gulls . 
2173 => the visibility had reduced to a few feet and a strange white light enveloped everything . 
2174 => the fog curtailed my senses and i began to wonder if i had boarded a ghost ship . 
2175 => but the only ghost on board was me . 
2176 => my head hurt terribly and i felt nauseous . 
2177 => all i could do was to press myself back into my hiding place and sit there shivering . 
2178 => every few minutes i caught myself muttering ego sum dominus temporis . 
2179 => the all embracing clouds clung with a clammy tenacity . 
2180 => all my senses were afloat . 
2181 => all references had gone . 
2182 => the eerie echoing of unseen gulls followed the boat like aerial spirits crying in the wind . 
2183 => i could not tell if my hearing was right or wrong . 
2184 => time seemed to telescope out in the white world . 
2185 => for a terrible moment , i thought i was back on the quay . 
2186 => i reflected on the events of just an hour before . 
2187 => was i really here ? 
2188 => what had the white crystal done back there ? 
2189 => who was the body on the quay ? 
2190 => was it ? 
2191 => for a moment , i panicked . 
2192 => but my head was clearing and the white light getting brighter all around . 
2193 => what did it matter ? 
2194 => here i was , on the ferry to the big city . 
2195 => change came suddenly : the fog bank billowed away behind the ferry and we emerged into bright sunshine . 
2196 => the contrast was unnerving . 
2197 => the blinds lifted from my eyes and my ears were no longer deaf . 
2198 => the monochrome world burst into brilliant life . 
2199 => clear space filled my mind , colour soaked into my eyes : the sky was sapphire blue ; the sea was aquamarine . 
2200 => the sun was already warming my face . 
2201 => in the space of a minute the whole world had changed completely . 
2202 => my aching head had cleared miraculously into fresh new confidence . 
2203 => the bright morning light made me squint and blink . 
2204 => i looked around across the sparkling waves to a place i had never really seen before . 
2205 => the ferry was less than a mile from the big city harbour . 
2206 => the buildings towered on the skyline . 
2207 => glass walls reflected the sky in a dazzling display of jet and emerald . 
2208 => peak upon peak of mountainous sky scrapers ranged back into the heart of the city . 
2209 => closer , the harbour was alive with vessels arriving and leaving . 
2210 => derricks and cranes lined the docksides . 
2211 => ships of massive bulk wallowed in the wharves waiting for the cranes to disgorge their treasured cargoes . 
2212 => pleasure boats and yachts skimmed across the waters , criss-crossing the harbour to the marina where forests of masts , with rigging slapping , lay tangled against the morning sky . 
2213 => two dolphins arced and dove alongside the ferry . 
2214 => their sleek bodies dazzled me with their brilliant display and playful mastery of the sea . 
2215 => i thought that the world , too , seemed to wear a fresh , happy smile at that moment of new pleasure . 
2216 => the bold , bright buildings grew in magnificence and stature as the ferry closed in to the terminus . 
2217 => cars and trucks on the freeways gleamed , as they processed in a ceaseless multitude , across the six lane deck of a suspension bridge . 
2218 => it rose and curved across the harbour entrance in a single perfect majestic span imitating the dolphins that raced below . 
2219 => far off , i could see the smoky stacks of the factories and the distant glint of metalwork strung with a webbing of silver pipes . 
2220 => chimneys , like great twisted candles , spouted yellow , red and white smoke into the sky . 
2221 => below , giant cylindrical tanks sprawled down to the sea . 
2222 => i knew from my talks with frank that this edifice was the great bay oil refinery . 
2223 => i watched all these things and more with a sense of awe and wonder as the ferry came in to dock . 
2224 => it was like stepping forward in time . 
2225 => i realised that suidhe was not only old but also old fashioned . 
2226 => the island had formed in a different era of history and the ferry was like a time machine to the future over the sea . 
2227 => the closer the boat came to the shore , the less of the overall picture i could see and the clearer the detail became . 
2228 => like a huge jigsaw , hundreds of pieces formed every part . 
2229 => the hum of the city came across the water like the sound of a hive . 
2230 => engine oil and sulphur smarted my sense of smell . 
2231 => the sound of engines thrummed in my ears and the gleam of steel glared at my eyes . 
2232 => all these things tantalised my senses with new delights . 
2233 => even the fresh warmth of the sun appeared to increase to a close dry heat as we came near to the city . 
2234 => the glistening green and black glass terminal building lay in welcome , like a vast iridescent beetle . 
2235 => the passengers came out onto the deck of the ferry and stood in a small group around the gangway , some chatting together , others quietly watching . 
2236 => no one had noticed me silently waiting in my place in the stern . 
2237 => it was as if i wasnt there . 
2238 => the boat docked smoothly and calmly with a precision born of confidence and regularity . 
2239 => the gangway dropped down and engaged with the terminus walkway as the ferry engines slowed to an idle . 
2240 => i watched the passengers walk casually down into the gaping hall of the building and away . 
2241 => they seemed to just disappear into the vastness of the place . 
2242 => no-one was watching the ferry or seemed the least interested in me . 
2243 => i got up . 
2244 => this time i felt steady and clear headed . 
2245 => i walked round the deck , down the gangway and across the walkway into the building . 
2246 => i didnt look to either side as i went . 
2247 => strangely , i did not feel nervous . 
2248 => i was sure i would be fine . 
2249 => the shining stone floor seemed doubly solid and still after the gently rolling deck of the ferry . 
2250 => there were no ticket collectors at the empty booths and i walked on through . 
2251 => i had arrived ; i was in the big city . 
2252 => i walked to the centre of the great hall where i stood and gazed about me . 
2253 => i looked up and around and across . 
2254 => the place was unlike anything i had seen before . 
2255 => kiosks and benches lined the walls and lights reflected on the marble floors . 
2256 => nothing appeared to support the glinting glass of the roof ; it was magic . 
2257 => some pigeons fluttered through the artificial sky above while others ambled lamely on the smooth ground , pecking and picking at any small item , be it food or not . 
2258 => this place was a universe to them . 
2259 => nameless music echoed and reverberated , occasionally punctuated by an unintelligible announcement spoken by a robotic female voice . 
2260 => the voice , which emanated from nowhere , spoke to no one ; the people ignored it . 
2261 => arrays of giant lights spread artificial daylight through the thin air inside despite the sun that blazed through the blue sky above . 
2262 => the building appeared contrived and artificial , and yet it was magnificent ; the place was like a modern palace . 
2263 => i did not notice the other people at first , but here and there , around the kiosks and within waiting rooms , sat men and women , boys and girls . 
2264 => they seemed insignificant in the vast hall . 
2265 => i knew that ships went from here up and down the coast and across the ocean . 
2266 => but traffic on a saturday was light and it was still early . 
2267 => many of the people were as silent as statues and they were all doing almost nothing . 
2268 => some read newspapers , hiding behind the broadsheets ; some looked at the ground , seemingly deep in thought ; some stared out vacantly from glazed eyes ; but they all waited , passing time . 
2269 => a cleaner walked lazily past , pushing a giant broom , meandering across the floor , whistling as he went . 
2270 => two old men , very scruffily dressed , shuffled across to a rubbish bin where they rummaged through the detritus inside . 
2271 => they walked on , disappointed , and mumbled incoherently to each other . 
2272 => a rolled up coat lying black , formless and ragged , by a bench , contained a man , asleep . 
2273 => were these the big city people , so silent , grey and inanimate ? 
2274 => i thought . 
2275 => they had grim mouths and empty eyes . 
2276 => i watched them yawning and waiting as the numbers on the clock clicked on , interminably . 
2277 => my heart cheered when i saw a large , smiling woman , dressed in an apron and cap . 
2278 => she was leaning across a clean metal counter in a kiosk and talked , with flamboyant gestures , to an old grey man who was sitting on a stool drinking tea . 
2279 => itll lead to no good , you see if im right , she was saying , as the man appeared to ignore her . 
2280 => the cleaner walked up and interrupted her harangue . 
2281 => ivy , give us a tea , luv , and he sat on another stool and rested his elbows on the bar top . 
2282 => i realised again , that i was hungry and walked towards the kiosk to see what snack i could buy . 
2283 => i would save the rest of my biscuits until later . 
2284 => before i reached the place , i remembered the crystal . 
2285 => it had been in my hand all this time . 
2286 => even as the thought arose in my mind , a voice close behind called out : oi ! 
2287 => you , and i turned involuntarily . 
2288 => yea , you . 
2289 => come ere . 
2290 => i stood staring at two young men with black jackets , black shiny hair , black glasses and blue jeans . 
2291 => they were almost carbon copies but for their difference in size , which was comical . 
2292 => the lean tall one had spoken to me . 
2293 => all thoughts of magic instantly left me as i slipped the crystal out of my hand and into the leather pouch . 
2294 => i remembered old eric had told me that the magic was not for the mainland . 
2295 => but here and now , old eric seemed from a different world . 
2296 => he must have known , i thought . 
2297 => the two sinister young men were leaning on a steel railing beside an escalator that flowed up and out of sight . 
2298 => the short fat one chewed and grinned as the other man beckoned me across . 
2299 => i did not like the look of either of them , but i walked over anyway . 
2300 => the fat man spat the gum out of his mouth and then he asked me : where you come from ? 
2301 => before i could answer , the fat man started to walk , signalling for me to follow . 
2302 => i obediently followed him while the other man walked on behind . 
2303 => suidhe , the island , i replied and the fat one laughed with a vicious scathing cackle . 
2304 => the men kept walking . 
2305 => i felt an almost imperceptible movement beside me , just as the fat one pointed to something up towards the roof and said : look up there ! 
2306 => he stopped and looked . 
2307 => i followed his pointing finger and someone patted me on the back . 
2308 => ivy , in her kiosk , looked up at the three of us and shouted : hey you , leave him , hes just a kid . 
2309 => i heard a slight noise behind and turned to look , but the thin man had gone and when i turned back the other way , the fat man was just disappearing up the escalator at the side of the hall . 
2310 => i went over to the kiosk . 
2311 => ivy and the cleaner looked at me sadly . 
2312 => you wan na keep away from the likes of them , dear , said ivy . 
2313 => theyll clean you out in no time . 
2314 => what do you mean ? 
2315 => i asked but they just looked at each other and shook their heads . 
2316 => i asked for a cup of tea and a biscuit but when i felt in my pocket for my wallet - it had gone . 
2317 => i turned red with embarrassment and anger at having been so easily duped so early in the day . 
2318 => no one had ever told me about thieves , we didnt have any on the island . 
2319 => here you are . 
2320 => have the tea and cake on me and welcome , ivy said . 
2321 => but take my advice and go home before something serious happens . 
2322 => i couldnt imagine what could be more serious , but i thanked her , drank the tea and left . 
2323 => i checked my pocket - the crystal was still there in the leather pouch and i sighed in relief . 
2324 => although i had not found a very promising start to my adventure , i decided that it was time to see the city . 
2325 => i had franks new address on a piece of paper and i intended to make my way to that destination . 
2326 => i would only be in the city for one day , i would catch the evening ferry home again , and i could survive until then without the little money i had brought . 
2327 => the two thieves would be disappointed when they counted their haul . 
2328 => i found my way to the exit and strode out through the automatic glass doors onto the pavement of a busy road alongside a huge car park . 
2329 => the weather was changing and the sun was now invisible behind mounting grey clouds , but the day was still fair . 
2330 => parked taxis and cars lined the roadway . 
2331 => i could see a bus station across the way , where large yellow buses parked neatly beside the shelters . 
2332 => each bus had a different number and name on its destination board . 
2333 => the noise and smell of all these vehicles engulfed me . 
2334 => i felt that i had walked into some monstrous mechanical farmyard . 
2335 => the place was squalid , and empty cans , cigarette ends and squashed packaging lay abandoned on the grimy pavements . 
2336 => despite the constant arrival and departure of so many vehicles , it struck me that few people seemed to be going anywhere or doing anything in particular . 
2337 => everybody outside waited , as they had within . 
2338 => the pavements beyond the terminus seemed deserted . 
2339 => nobody walked in the big city ; everyone went by car , by taxi , or by bus . 
2340 => i would have taken a bus to the city centre but without money i had no choice but to walk . 
2341 => i started walking along the road past the bus station and towards the centre of the city . 
2342 => the road , built along the top of an old stone causeway , was wide enough for two lanes of vehicles in each direction . 
2343 => there was a fuming snake of traffic crawling along towards the distant junction at the freeway . 
2344 => i walked past the cars and buses and lorries , looking at each one in turn , taking it all in . 
2345 => i had never seen so many vehicles in one place , even in pictures . 
2346 => the engines rattled and whined while brakes hissed and squeaked . 
2347 => every few minutes , the whole parade of vehicles would surge forward , engines revving , opening up like some giant concertina , and then collapse down , squealing and hissing to a tight stop . 
2348 => the drivers of these vehicles leaned out of their windows or clutched at their wheels , or stared into their mirrors , or talked to themselves . 
2349 => they were oblivious to the world outside , except for the vehicle in front . 
2350 => occasionally , an irate horn would blare or someone would shout , although there seemed to be no reason for it . 
2351 => the freeway at the junction was very different . 
2352 => it was wider than the terminus road and the traffic never stopped but raced past , unceasingly , at such a pace that i could barely distinguish the vehicles one from another . 
2353 => three lanes of traffic flowed by each way in a rattling , roaring stampede . 
2354 => the pavement stopped abruptly at the junction ; there was nowhere to go . 
2355 => i stood in front of the snarling morass of traffic and blinked stupidly in the glaring light , as i wondered what to do next . 
2356 => i knew that the city centre lay beyond me ; in the direction i had first started to walk . 
2357 => i could see the shining towers on the horizon , but there was an impenetrable wall of moving vehicles barring my way . 
2358 => a deep ditch and a wild terrain of empty marshland lay on either side of the road . 
2359 => bricks and rubble erupted through the green slimy water and muddy puddles . 
2360 => an occasional half-dead bush or reed-covered patch grew stubbornly up through the desolation . 
2361 => it was an uninviting place , a wilderness that spread into the distance . 
2362 => the green soupy water smelled of decay and the surface buzzed angrily with hordes of insects . 
2363 => gas bubbles glooped to the surface and dragonflies dipped and danced in the air . 
2364 => i looked again at the frantic freeway and turned away . 
2365 => it seemed there was no alternative but to walk back the way i had come . 
2366 => i retraced my steps and , to my surprise , i saw a man in a grey coat and a wide brimmed hat standing on the path and looking out across the wasteland . 
2367 => i hurried past the dark figure without looking up . 
2368 => a few minutes later , i stood outside the ferry terminus again . 
2369 => i looked back to the road and saw two cars stop and the waiting man get into the first , before they both sped off towards the city . 
2370 => as i watched two other men walked out along the same road to the place where the man had stood before looking back towards me . 
2371 => they wore smart grey business suits . 
2372 => one had a red tie and one blue . 
2373 => i looked around for a different way to go . 
2374 => there was one other road that slipped quietly away towards the docks . 
2375 => it had no cars travelling on it , but a train-like parade of parked lorries lined one side . 
2376 => i followed this road , which had no footpath , to the corner of the terminus building . 
2377 => it turned first one way and then the other , zig-zagging between large , formless warehouses . 
2378 => the main road had numerous spurs that led to further warehouses and yards . 
2379 => occasionally , a lorry would thunder past , vibrating the ground with its weight as it sped by . 
2380 => i could not see far in any direction because of the towering warehouses all around but i was able to make steady progress along the road . 
2381 => the dusty tarmac was shady and quiet , and my footfall echoed from the featureless walls . 
2382 => although there didnt appear to be any signs or clues to direction , i guessed that i was making my way by a circuitous route toward the city centre . 
2383 => i stopped suddenly to tie my shoe lace and above the distant hum of traffic i could hear the sound of steps behind me stopping too . 
2384 => i looked but could see no-one . 
2385 => distance in the big city is a thing of illusion . 
2386 => a distance that appears to be short when seen from the start becomes progressively longer as you make your way . 
2387 => so it was in the docklands , where i was walking . 
2388 => until you try walking in the big city , you are not aware how very big it all is . 
2389 => the scale of things is quite wrong for mere humans . 
2390 => it is a land for giants , mechanical giants . 
2391 => i was aware that my available time was passing quickly and i didnt seem to be getting any closer to my destination . 
2392 => i cursed the thieves who had stolen my money and i began to despair of ever seeing the city centre . 
2393 => i thought of asking someone for help , but there was no one to ask : the place was deserted except for the footpad still following . 
2394 => i had a wary feeling growing inside . 
2395 => i went around one more right-angled bend and i finally came across something different . 
2396 => i felt cheered by the sight . 
2397 => before me was a ship . 
2398 => it was the largest thing i had ever seen . 
2399 => even from a distance , it was impressive - a vast black bulk that filled the quayside . 
2400 => i approached the monster open-mouthed , until i stood only twenty feet away . 
2401 => the deck was as high as the roof of a warehouse building . 
2402 => the bridge , at the rear of the vessel , rose up as high again . 
2403 => above it all was a massive red funnel . 
2404 => hawsers as thick as a mans body spiralled down to the quayside close by where i stood . 
2405 => i turned towards the city and saw a solitary man in a grey coat leaning against a gantry in the distance . 
2406 => his face was hidden in the shadows cast by the broad brim of his hat . 
2407 => he appeared to be looking out to sea . 
2408 => who was this man ? 
2409 => i decided to speak to him , to satisfy my curiosity . 
2410 => the tall , bird-like cranes , that travelled on rails the length of the docks , were unloading some of the other ships . 
2411 => i walked on , past other vessels , and a slow moving train overtook me , hooting as it approached . 
2412 => two dirty industrial engines were pulling perhaps a hundred wagons that rumbled and clanked and clattered their way towards the end of the quay . 
2413 => the grey man was very close , on the other side of the railway and i waited for the train to pass . 
2414 => the last wagon rolled away and i crossed the lines to where the man had been , but the place was empty : no one was visible . 
2415 => all the while , above me , the eternal spying eyes of the gulls wheeled through the air . 
2416 => a uniform grey mass of cloud now covered the sky in every direction and a small cool breeze was stirring and ruffling the tops of the murky green waves in the bay . 
2417 => the rain drifted across in a drizzled mist blowing on the wind . 
2418 => heavier drops followed and the steady patter soon turned the dusty road into a gleaming black lake . 
2419 => i put up my hood and huddled along faster . 
2420 => as i walked , i looked out for a place under cover where i could stop and let the shower pass . 
2421 => i splashed my way down a side road , to the relative shelter of an open warehouse loading bay , and i sat down on a deserted concrete plinth . 
2422 => i took out my food and munched my way thoughtfully through some biscuits . 
2423 => i carefully preserved some for later . 
2424 => to my great disappointment , the sky darkened still further and the rain hailed down with gusto . 
2425 => to avoid a soaking , i stood up and backed into the shadows of the loading bay . 
2426 => the rain descended like a curtain across the entrance way . 
2427 => i stopped and watched it , listening to the drumming rattle on the iron roof . 
2428 => in that noisy darkness i heard another sound : a whistle . 
2429 => suddenly , on the periphery of vision , shadows emerged from the gloom on either side . 
2430 => i tensed and froze . 
2431 => seconds later , six youths surrounded me . 
2432 => they remained silent and watching . 
2433 => one of them stepped forward , a tall lad with long unkempt hair . 
2434 => i noticed he wore worn out brown leather boots , and a faded sleeveless denim jacket . 
2435 => his turned up trousers were too short and thin with age . 
2436 => the lad had strong , tattooed arms and small podgy hands . 
2437 => one hand had only three fingers with which he stabbed the air in front of me . 
2438 => whats your name ? 
2439 => he asked . 
2440 => his voice was rough and worn , like his clothes . 
2441 => he sounded much older than he looked . 
2442 => harry , i replied . 
2443 => whats yours ? 
2444 => this question obviously surprised him and he opened his mouth to speak but changed his mind . 
2445 => suddenly he laughed , a loud rattling nervous laugh . 
2446 => tuffy , muffy , puffy , huffy , duffy and crystal , said tuffy , muffy , puffy , huffy , duffy and crystal in quick rotation . 
2447 => i span around as they answered . 
2448 => i looked at tuffy again . 
2449 => in the dizzy half-light he looked familiar , but how could he be ? 
2450 => he was clearly the leader , a confident , commanding person with a glint in his eye . 
2451 => dont you know who we are ? 
2452 => asked tuffy . 
2453 => no , i replied . 
2454 => im lost . 
2455 => everybody knows who we are , sneered muffy . 
2456 => weve been watching you , said huffy . 
2457 => and so have the others , said crystal . 
2458 => i suddenly realised that crystal was a girl . 
2459 => crystal smiled . 
2460 => the storm still raged outside . 
2461 => tuffy shouted , tell him who we are , boys . 
2462 => they all chanted together , stomping their feet in time and drowning out the sound of the storm : were rough and were tough , you dont fool with us if you aint big enough cause were the boys on the block we run and we rock everyone knows our name ... 
2463 => the big city gang ! 
2464 => they pushed me backwards and forwards from one to the other as they sang out the chant , propelling me around the circle until i was quite dizzy and exhausted . 
2465 => when they had finished , they stood around me , grinning and i sank down involuntarily to the ground , shaking but still only half-scared of these fearsome youths . 
2466 => silence , hissed tuffy . 
2467 => he edged his way to the opening and looked out . 
2468 => looking at me , he waved me over . 
2469 => look out there , harry , he whispered , do you know those two ? 
2470 => two grey suited men were in the distance walking slowly down the dock and looking in each open doorway as they came . 
2471 => one had a red tie and one blue . 
2472 => no , i replied . 
2473 => but i saw them looking around by the ferry terminal . 
2474 => we stepped back in to the dark . 
2475 => time to go . 
2476 => out the back way . 
2477 => take him to the star chamber , ordered tuffy . 
2478 => i found myself being dragged up and away in an instant . 
2479 => they jostled me along at a running pace between them down long , wet , deserted alleys amidst the buildings . 
2480 => twisting and turning , i lost all sense of direction . 
2481 => tuffy , in the lead , disappeared through an unseen doorway and we all followed into a dark passageway and down long flights of steps . 
2482 => our footsteps echoed but there was no other sound . 
2483 => the passageway went down a long lightless slope and ended at a heavy door . 
2484 => the door opened smoothly and the company entered a chamber . 
2485 => behind us the door clanged shut with a sound like a deep metallic gong . 
2486 => all about , it was pitch black and i could see nothing . 
2487 => suddenly , in the silence , there was a ping and a brilliant light illuminated the strangest of places . 
2488 => i blinked in the harsh brightness and looked around . 
2489 => the big city gang still surrounded me , but they seemed relaxed . 
2490 => we had clearly arrived in the star chamber . 
2491 => the room was a large , circular brick-lined chamber with a high domed roof . 
2492 => there were six doors around the circumference of the chamber , all identical and all shut , through one of which we had entered , but i didnt know which one . 
2493 => there was a large old wooden table and a number of chairs , no two of which were alike , standing on a threadbare circular rug . 
2494 => a stately chandelier , which would not have been out of place in a palace , was hanging down in the centre of the room . 
2495 => it had been fixed to an old hook with a rusty iron chain . 
2496 => the light from this device sparkled out and rebounded from the equally dramatic ceiling . 
2497 => an ornate and brightly painted scene of clouds and cherubs with , at their centre , a magnificent chasm surrounded by trumpeting angels covered the dome . 
2498 => the whole effect was both dramatic and unnerving . 
2499 => tuffy and the gang had already seated themselves and waved me to a seat amongst them . 
2500 => i looked around at my companions and , in the luxurious light , was able to see them for the first time . 
2501 => they were as different as the chairs they occupied . 
2502 => tuffy , the tall , arrogant leader exuded calm control . 
2503 => his street-wise dress seemed faded in the magnificent chamber as he sat like a king amongst his knights . 
2504 => he filled elegant cut glass goblets with wine from an earthenware decanter and handed them around . 
2505 => i , too , received a glass . 
2506 => muffy sat at the right hand of the leader . 
2507 => he maintained a constant sneer on his otherwise indistinct face . 
2508 => his clothes mimicked those of tuffy , but failed through ill fit and muffys physical demeanour , to succeed in exerting anything but a comical expression of ineptitude . 
2509 => muffy had none of tuffys lean , gaunt , sharp style ; he was more of a comfortable , fireside physique : a little overweight , a little short in stature , a little grey in pallor - an ordinary youth . 
2510 => puffy occupied the chair on the other side of tuffy . 
2511 => puffy was huge in girth and perched , rather than sat , on the chair ; he was too wide to fit in it . 
2512 => his not inconsiderable height seemed diminished by his weight . 
2513 => he had a schoolboy face adorned by a pair of broken horn-rimmed spectacles . 
2514 => he looked like a giant baby , pink and fat , and he was constantly wiping drops of perspiration away from his forehead . 
2515 => his completely bald head , which he often covered with a massive white stetson hat , dominated his whole appearance . 
2516 => he had put the hat down beside him on the table . 
2517 => the next chair contained huffy , whose purpose seemed to be to exaggerate the size of his companion . 
2518 => huffy was tiny , like a jockey . 
2519 => he stood about five feet tall and was a bony sallow youth . 
2520 => his clothes were several sizes too large . 
2521 => he wore a black suit and tie and had the pallid appearance of an undertakers assistant . 
2522 => he sat hunched over his glass , holding the stem with both hands curled around it like claws . 
2523 => his scrawny neck emerged turtle-like from the shiny jacket while his badly broken nose gave his face a beak-like quality . 
2524 => this vulturish creature scowled across the table at me without blinking , whilst constantly muttering oaths . 
2525 => duffy sat opposite the leader . 
2526 => he dressed like a farm boy with check shirt and jeans . 
2527 => his arms and legs seemed out of all proportion to the body and reached awkwardly out from his clothes . 
2528 => the small eyes and large mouth seemed permanently surprised . 
2529 => he sat with his hands in his pockets and chewed gum whilst pushing back the chair onto its spindly hind legs with his own large limbs splayed out in front . 
2530 => i noticed that he spoke to no one but frequently laughed , making a sound like a braying donkey . 
2531 => the last chair was a bar stool and on it perched crystal . 
2532 => she seemed quite out of place in the company , yet she also seemed to occupy some special position . 
2533 => the first impression was not of a girl at all . 
2534 => she wore a black leather jacket and loose jeans . 
2535 => she sat , legs apart and elbows on the table , toying with a small length of knotted rope . 
2536 => her dishevelled red hair hung in limp strands across her face . 
2537 => on closer inspection , it was possible to view beneath those tawny shadows and see the clear grey eyes and smooth creamy freckled skin of a distinctive girls face . 
2538 => when everyone had received their wine , the company stood up and raised their goblets . 
2539 => tuffy sang out : to the big city gang , and the reply came from all the others , the big city gang . 
2540 => the shout echoed from the domed roof and rang around the chamber like a bell sounding . 
2541 => everyone sat down except the leader , who looked at me with a gleam in his eye . 
2542 => welcome to the star chamber , harry ! 
2543 => he shouted and everyone laughed . 
2544 => i looked up sheepishly but could not reply . 
2545 => it was all stranger than fiction to me . 
2546 => crystal leaned over , nudged me and whispered , its all right , harry , drink up . 
2547 => they wont hurt you , youre precious . 
2548 => the assembly settled down to chatter and hubbub , while huffy stared at me continuously and scowled . 
2549 => chapter six - the star chamber the party in the star chamber continued for some time and i felt worried . 
2550 => what was i doing there ? 
2551 => why was i precious ? 
2552 => the strange group of people around me seemed animated , happy and relaxed , excepting huffy , who never spoke to any one and who followed every move i made . 
2553 => i only spoke when spoken to , mainly by crystal , who seemed concerned to look after me . 
2554 => some of the party went out of the chamber for a while and returned with a trolley laden with food . 
2555 => that such an ill-kempt group appeared to be so organised , surprised me . 
2556 => were there others behind the scenes ? 
2557 => we all ate well and the food was good . 
2558 => i asked where it came from and muffy laughed and said it had been given to them . 
2559 => more drinks came after the meal . 
2560 => i felt tired and worried when tuffy came up to me and said , harry , lets you and me go into the other room for a minute . 
2561 => i followed him through one of the doors and into a vaulted corridor that had a number of other passages leading from it . 
2562 => tuffy unlocked a steel door and beckoned me in . 
2563 => the room was small and sparsely furnished with two chairs , a table and a rusty filing cabinet . 
2564 => there was no natural light but a metal lamp hung from the cement ceiling . 
2565 => take a seat , harry , said tuffy and he stood opposite me at the table . 
2566 => looking down , tuffy spoke , they want you , harry . 
2567 => he raised his eyes to me , tell me why , he said and he looked at me with a penetrating stare . 
2568 => i hesitated , who wants me ? 
2569 => i replied . 
2570 => cmon harry , dont fool with me . 
2571 => i looked back blankly . 
2572 => tuffy whistled between his teeth . 
2573 => you saw him harry , the man in the grey coat , started tuffy . 
2574 => some people call him the follower . 
2575 => suddenly i looked up . 
2576 => so , you know what im talking about , harry ? 
2577 => yes , i said . 
2578 => no , i mean , i dont know . 
2579 => what do you mean ? 
2580 => then theres those other two . 
2581 => weve never seen them before , but they were looking for something too and my guess is that something is you . 
2582 => but why me ? 
2583 => im only here to visit the big city , i replied . 
2584 => i have to be back tonight . 
2585 => i dont understand whats happening . 
2586 => harry , what have you got that they want ? 
2587 => i dont know , i lied . 
2588 => tuffy looked at me and methodically tapped a pencil on the table . 
2589 => then he said , okay , harry , well show you the big city .. 
2590 => tonight , and he stood up and motioned me to follow him . 
2591 => we returned to the star chamber and i saw that the food and drink had gone . 
2592 => the gang stood together awaiting our arrival . 
2593 => they turned and looked as we entered . 
2594 => harry wants to see the big city , boys , said tuffy . 
2595 => lets do the centre of town tonight . 
2596 => this announcement resulted in a cheer from the company and they immediately began to head for the doors and disperse . 
2597 => crystal , said tuffy , you take harry , but remember , hes precious , and he laughed . 
2598 => crystal turned and looked at me . 
2599 => come on , harry , she called and i followed her out of the door into the dark passage beyond . 
2600 => where are we ? 
2601 => i asked . 
2602 => what is this place ? 
2603 => this is our place , she replied . 
2604 => its an old underground hospital built during the great war . 
2605 => we have borrowed it . 
2606 => theres a whole network of tunnels down here , some of them go for miles . 
2607 => but where do you live ? 
2608 => we live here , she waved her hands around and laughed . 
2609 => apart from the rats , its all right . 
2610 => are there any others ? 
2611 => i asked . 
2612 => you ask too much , harry , she replied . 
2613 => follow me and ill show you something really good . 
2614 => crystal began to jog down the corridor ahead . 
2615 => fleetingly , i thought of escape but i was hopelessly lost and besides , there was something about crystal i liked . 
2616 => just thinking of her made my cheeks burn ; i followed . 
2617 => we ran down the twisting , badly lit passages , past doors and chambers , until we reached a large , heavy door , hung on massive hinges and circular in shape , like the entrance to a bank vault . 
2618 => we spun the clamps that held it closed and swung it open . 
2619 => the door was about a foot thick and solid . 
2620 => the weight was so great that we could only move it slowly . 
2621 => i could feel a breeze blowing through the gap as the door opened and the sound of water emerged from the darkness beyond . 
2622 => it reminded me of the cave on sgurr-cavan . 
2623 => careful inside , its slippery , she called above the sound of the falling water . 
2624 => go to the railing . 
2625 => i went forward gingerly in the dark and found a smooth , cold , wet railing that i gripped . 
2626 => i stood hesitantly while crystal found a light switch . 
2627 => the dim light revealed an underground river that disappeared into the distance . 
2628 => it flowed through a brick-lined tunnel and the water tumbled over a weir below my feet into a hidden cavern . 
2629 => the air was heavy with moisture and the walls were green with mossy looking growths and algae . 
2630 => there was a small landing stage to one side , and a large wooden canoe , complete with paddles , tied up to a railing . 
2631 => get in , shouted crystal . 
2632 => well go for a ride . 
2633 => we boarded the small craft and started to journey up the river . 
2634 => at first , it was hard work paddling against the current but we made steady progress . 
2635 => the sound of the weir receded and a watery silence ensued , broken only by the constant dripping from the roof and the occasional splash of rats darting for safety as we approached . 
2636 => we didnt paddle quickly , but set a leisurely pace . 
2637 => i looked ahead at the back of my companion and beyond . 
2638 => in the quiet of the place i felt a new peace and trust . 
2639 => i began to talk to crystal . 
2640 => crystal , i asked , am i a prisoner ? 
2641 => no , she replied , we have just borrowed you for a bit . 
2642 => what is all this about ? 
2643 => i asked . 
2644 => i dont know why , but theyre after you . 
2645 => we found out , so we got you first . 
2646 => youre better off with us . 
2647 => but i need to go home tonight , theres only one ferry . 
2648 => if im not home ill be missed . 
2649 => dont worry harry , she said , but you must trust me or i cant help you . 
2650 => i dont see how i can , i dont even know you , i replied . 
2651 => harry , you dont have to know people to trust them .. 
2652 => now , youll see the city with us , tonight , and then we can worry about getting you home , she laughed . 
2653 => the lights in the tunnel blinked twice and crystal stopped paddling . 
2654 => time to turn around , she said . 
2655 => we have to go back . 
2656 => awkwardly , i turned to face forward , followed by crystal , who slipped around with practiced ease and grace . 
2657 => the journey back through the tunnel was easy and we drifted along with the current . 
2658 => harry , said crystal quietly , this is my secret river . 
2659 => how do you mean ? 
2660 => i asked . 
2661 => no-one else knows about this . 
2662 => the others dont know , only us . 
2663 => why ? 
2664 => i began . 
2665 => i searched all over the docks for this river , said crystal . 
2666 => you see , this is my river and it was lost . 
2667 => then an old lady told me where to look and i found it . 
2668 => youre not like the others , i said . 
2669 => why have you shown me this ? 
2670 => because i love it , its home from home . 
2671 => i live a long way away from here , near the snowy mountains , where this river just begins . 
2672 => my father has a farm but they built a dam and now there isnt enough water and the farm is dying . 
2673 => so my father sent me away to the big city and i stayed with an aunt but she left me on my own . 
2674 => i wanted to find the river and the big city gang showed me their underground star chamber . 
2675 => i thought the river must be near . 
2676 => every day , i searched the passages until i found it , but i never told the others , they wouldnt understand . 
2677 => theyre not bad people : theyre city people , but they dont fit in and they live down here like rats . 
2678 => theyd be lost in the country . 
2679 => how do they survive ? 
2680 => i asked . 
2681 => they borrow things from the city : food , clothes , not much really . 
2682 => people say they are criminals and dangerous , but they only take stuff that isnt really needed , replied crystal . 
2683 => but why did they want me , why am i so precious ? 
2684 => i asked . 
2685 => there are others , other gangs , not so nice . 
2686 => but theres a kind of network and messages get passed . 
2687 => tuffy knows everyone ; hes been around . 
2688 => he heard that some big people wanted to get hold of you , so he figured you must have something valuable . 
2689 => but now hes got you , i think he cant quite decide what to do with you . 
2690 => if youve got something valuable i should lose it fast . 
2691 => but dont try running away or the others will catch you for sure , and that wouldnt be good . 
2692 => youre lucky , we found you first . 
2693 => now everyone else will be going mad looking for you . 
2694 => stick with us and youll be safe . 
2695 => but i dont want to stick with you , i replied . 
2696 => i cant . 
2697 => ive got to go home today . 
2698 => dont worry , whispered crystal quietly . 
2699 => i have a way . 
2700 => stay by me tonight when we go out and maybe we can both get home . 
2701 => there was silence for a moment and then crystal began to sing . 
2702 => her voice filled the dark space with a slow , haunting , liquid clear and beautiful sound . 
2703 => the words of her song hovered dreamily on the air . 
2704 => the magic of that journey changed my life . 
2705 => waters run in silent dark ... 
2706 => deeper blackness falls ; time has lost her destiny while invisible she calls . 
2707 => freedom flows towards the sea forever moving down ; the mountains far still call to me from their icy crown . 
2708 => the tongues of liquid moving thought like flames they flicker through the tunnels where the meanings sought to question which is true . 
2709 => i listen filled with hope and fear , i pass into the night ; the morning brings the answer clear with the dawning of new light . 
2710 => the star chamber was empty when we returned , but one by one the gang entered through the various doors that surrounded it . 
2711 => tuffy waited until all were present and then he set off at a trot while the rest of us followed . 
2712 => i was in the middle of the group and huffy ran close behind me . 
2713 => the journey to the surface was brisk and uneventful . 
2714 => the gang moved quickly but did not speak . 
2715 => they ran to a collective rhythm and they moved like a machine . 
2716 => even puffy , the fat one , seemed to propel himself along without effort . 
2717 => the gang did not all go out onto the street together but slipped out , one by one , at intervals , through several different exits . 
2718 => huffy suddenly took my shoulder and guided me firmly into a side passage . 
2719 => wait , he whispered . 
2720 => i waited silently while he went ahead and opened a door onto a side street . 
2721 => the light poured in from outside and he slipped out . 
2722 => a few seconds later he returned and said , follow . 
2723 => we stepped together onto the street and i blinked in the afternoon light . 
2724 => time in the underground world of the star chamber had no reference and without the light and heat of the sun it was easy to forget that the rest of the world existed . 
2725 => outside , it was a quiet , lazy saturday afternoon in the city . 
2726 => the rain had cleared away and a warm sun shone brightly down . 
2727 => without the gang around us , we were just a couple of lads out and about . 
2728 => on the street , we walked normally and , after a while , huffy started to talk to me in short disjointed sentences . 
2729 => you come from that island , he said . 
2730 => never been there , never want to neither .. 
2731 => one day im going to be leader , you just see .. 
2732 => a ship went down over there last year , still down , too ... 
2733 => this all flooded once , long time ago .. 
2734 => biggest port on the coast , this .. 
2735 => and so huffy went on in his mechanical drone of a voice and we walked on towards the city centre . 
2736 => we changed direction often to avoid detection and grey followers . 
2737 => i still felt lost but occasional glimpses between the buildings confirmed that we were getting closer to the city centre . 
2738 => the walk into town took a long time . 
2739 => it was much further than i had realised . 
2740 => the appearance of the surrounding buildings changed as we moved on . 
2741 => the warehouse district gave way to the factory district and the factory district gave way to the shopping district . 
2742 => we had encountered hardly any other people all the while we had been walking , but in the shopping district , we found another world . 
2743 => i had never seen so many people or so many shops . 
2744 => there were great car parks on the edge occupied by rows and rows of shiny cars . 
2745 => the whole thing resembled a layer from a beehive with cars buzzing in and out and manoeuvring in constant motion . 
2746 => beyond the car parks , in the distance , were the shopping halls : glass and marble palaces filled with moving stairways and lifts and cascades of plants and waterfalls . 
2747 => the plate glass windows of dozens of gift and clothing shops were ranged along the walls of the halls . 
2748 => the squares and roofs held cafs and restaurants where shoppers sat idly chatting and passing the day . 
2749 => sugary music drifted through the air all the while , above the hubbub of people sliding their feet on the shiny marble floors . 
2750 => the colours were bright and exciting and the displays were full of the exotic . 
2751 => this is how the city works , said huffy . 
2752 => aint nothing but an onion , huffy explained . 
2753 => each district is surrounded by the next . 
2754 => an each district is split into four . 
2755 => the city was laid out in concentric rings called districts and areas , the north factory district or the east housing district . 
2756 => the east and west is where the workers live . 
2757 => it aint bad , but it aint good neither . 
2758 => up north is all the doctors and bosses . 
2759 => they dont mean no harm , but it aint exactly a friendly place know what i mean . 
2760 => all the rich bastards live down south . 
2761 => bunch of lazy stuck up pigs . 
2762 => thats where we go when we get hungry , and he laughed . 
2763 => when i was poor , i couldnt walk down south with all them golden boys . 
2764 => i stuck in the east , with the suckers . 
2765 => if you were one of us , you could walk about in east housing after dark no problem , but you wouldnt never go into south housing because the police would pick you up and hassle you . 
2766 => no reason , no law , just scared they are . 
2767 => them rich guys didnt dare go into east housing after dark . 
2768 => scared of us hoodlums , they are . 
2769 => like we ever would touch em , and he spat on the pavement . 
2770 => the big city gang go where we want , when we want , no stopping us , he stated proudly . 
2771 => these people here are all just sheep . 
2772 => baa , baa , one after the other . 
2773 => theyre scared of themselves . 
2774 => scared to be alone in case they meet us , huffy stated . 
2775 => come down here 3.00 oclock saturday . 
2776 => whole worlds here like they cant help themselves . 
2777 => go over to the factory district now : empty easy pickings . 
2778 => all these guys must wonder whats going on . 
2779 => wherever they go theres always a crowd . 
2780 => makes me laugh . 
2781 => with us , its different . 
2782 => when theyre here , were there , seeing what they dont need no more . 
2783 => the big city gang , it seemed , went to places when the crowd was away and he had sometimes spent days at a time seeing virtually nobody but his five friends . 
2784 => the next district that we entered was the housing district , which consisted of rows of identical terraced houses interspersed with numerous high-rise apartment blocks . 
2785 => the streets around these tenements were shabby and everything appeared worn out . 
2786 => this is east housing , said huffy . 
2787 => i used to live ere , and he grimaced as he looked at the rusty cars that lined the roads . 
2788 => aint never going to live ere again . 
2789 => all around the streets children roamed in gangs or played football . 
2790 => young mothers could be seen keeping an eye on them through the open windows and front doors . 
2791 => the roads of houses extended into the distance but ceased abruptly as we entered the office district . 
2792 => the place was empty of people . 
2793 => the many high towers that stood sentinel along the roads were dark ; it was the weekend . 
2794 => the only people to be seen were security guards , who eyed us suspiciously as we walked by , but returned to their outpost boxes when we had passed . 
2795 => we went through the old shopping district . 
2796 => this is the real old city , said huffy . 
2797 => used to be all proper shops an stuff . 
2798 => all gone now . 
2799 => all the nobs come ere to stuff their faces now . 
2800 => sometimes we come down ere at night and work round the clubs . 
2801 => always money to be made out of them drunks . 
2802 => but on saturday afternoon the place was quiet . 
2803 => the roads in this area were small and old fashioned and the buildings were quaint and decorative . 
2804 => every old shop seemed to be a club or restaurant . 
2805 => further on there were theatres . 
2806 => between and behind these buildings were grubby back alleys with empty crates and huge , overflowing bins . 
2807 => huffy sometimes took short cuts through these back yards . 
2808 => we stopped at an open door leading into a grubby kitchen . 
2809 => huffy poked his head in and a rough voice inside called out . 
2810 => she aint here . 
2811 => now push off . 
2812 => huffy returned , sullen and muttering . 
2813 => come on . 
2814 => shes there . 
2815 => hes lying . 
2816 => lets hit no.1 district . 
2817 => we walked through the government district . 
2818 => it had a completely different character and contained massive stone buildings large enough for giants . 
2819 => everything about these buildings was larger than reality . 
2820 => the doors were twice normal height , as were the windows . 
2821 => the entrances had impressive steps and portals . 
2822 => flags flew from the roofs and statues adorned the courtyards and squares . 
2823 => here , too , the offices were dark and the streets almost deserted . 
2824 => nothin ere . 
2825 => hate this place , said huffy and he looked small and insignificant against the massive stones . 
2826 => the centre area of the city was district one . 
2827 => the outskirts of district one contained a circle of tall , dramatic buildings . 
2828 => look . 
2829 => hotels . 
2830 => rich pickins , said huffy . 
2831 => each one of these hotels looked out to the front across a large park surrounded by a road and iron railings . 
2832 => each of the four sides of the park contained a massive and elaborate gate painted gold and red . 
2833 => car free avenues stretched across the grassy spaces beyond the gate . 
2834 => in the distance , it was possible to make out the forms of the hotels , which lined the further sides of the park . 
2835 => there was only one building of any size inside , set within its own railings and gardens . 
2836 => the building at the centre of the park was monumental both in scale and architecture . 
2837 => it sprawled with imposing symmetry , its massive windows pink and gold with the light of the late afternoon sun . 
2838 => whats that ? 
2839 => i asked . 
2840 => that , said huffy , pausing , is the presidential palace . 
2841 => of course , the president dont live there no more . 
2842 => now its the hq of the big city bank . 
2843 => thats the biggest bank in the world , yer know , gold bars and dimonds in there and , for the first time since i had met him , huffys voice lifted above his usual boring drone to contain a note of excitement . 
2844 => we stood for a while on the edge of the grass , behind a row of tall , grey plane trees , and we looked out across the expanse of the park . 
2845 => here and there , people walked in the shadows in ones or twos , or sat on benches . 
2846 => a solitary horseman was cantering across the grass towards a tree-lined dell in the distance . 
2847 => huffy started walking across the grass in a casual and circuitous route and i followed . 
2848 => a quarter of an hour later , we entered the ring of trees growing around the lip of a former clay pit . 
2849 => there , we saw the horseman , still mounted , at the foot of the hill and looking up at us with interest . 
2850 => huffy ran down the slope to the centre of the dell and i followed . 
2851 => as we approached , i realised that the horseman was crystal . 
2852 => she looked quite different up in the saddle . 
2853 => seated above her proud mount i thought she looked heroic . 
2854 => other shadows appeared around the banks and before long , the entire big city gang was standing together in a group . 
2855 => the light was fading into evening and the shadows had fallen across the old clay pit leaving the group well hidden . 
2856 => but when i looked up , i thought i saw the silhouette of a man standing on the edge looking down . 
2857 => it was no more than a grey shadow fleetingly standing by a tree . 
2858 => i blinked and looked again but the apparition had gone . 
2859 => the thought of mentioning it to the others fled as tuffy started to lay out the plan for the nights adventures . 
2860 => comrades and friends , he began in a quiet voice , we have come to district one to borrow some money . 
2861 => at first , i thought we were going to rob the bank , but a different plan was afoot and tuffy continued : the big city hotel has a casino on the roof where big money is won and lost . 
2862 => but gambling is a bad habit and we have a duty to cure the gamblers of their vice for at least one night ! 
2863 => around me , in the closing dark , i heard some chuckles . 
2864 => tuffy explained : muffy and i shall go up the service lift to interrupt the casino bank . 
2865 => huffy and puffy will wait at the bottom of the tower , in the garden , where we shall throw the money down in pillowcases . 
2866 => huffy and puffy will throw the bags over the hedge and into the ha-ha . 
2867 => thats a ditch to you , huffy . 
2868 => crystal will ride through the ha-ha in thirty minutes time and collect the bags on pegasus , thats crystals horse , harry . 
2869 => duffy and harry will stay here and lift that drain cover ready to let the money down to the hiding place . 
2870 => tuffy pointed out a large old drain cover , one of several that lay in the dell . 
2871 => we will collect the money another time , after it has been forgotten about . 
2872 => meanwhile , all comrades will return to the star chamber . 
2873 => we will make our way back by the usual routes . 
2874 => any questions ? 
2875 => a brief silence followed before the four other comrades left the clay pit leaving crystal and duffy with me . 
2876 => you had better get lifting , boys , said crystal , laughing . 
2877 => she sat on a tree stump while we examined the drain . 
2878 => it was old and rusty . 
2879 => supposing the money gets washed away ? 
2880 => i asked . 
2881 => now that would be a pity , replied crystal . 
2882 => but it wont , she said and in the semi-darkness i caught her giving me a wink . 
2883 => duffy had come prepared and pulled a jemmy from his cavernous jacket and began to attack the heavy rusty drain cover . 
2884 => we lifted it and peered into the dark below . 
2885 => i heard the sound of running water in the distance and the impression of space wafted up with a cool breeze . 
2886 => duffy shone a small torch down and we saw that the drain had no water directly below but appeared to be the entrance to some form of underground tank . 
2887 => then came a long wait . 
2888 => i started to speak : do you do this often ? 
2889 => i asked just as crystals horse raised its head and was listening intently . 
2890 => shh , whispered crystal and slipped off the tree stump , handing me pegasus reins as she did so . 
2891 => she dodged behind some trees and disappeared from view . 
2892 => a moment later i saw the silhouette of a man on the edge of the dell , almost invisible now . 
2893 => seconds later , another shadow , much smaller , silently slid up behind him and raised her hands high . 
2894 => idiot ! 
2895 => i breathed . 
2896 => i threw the reins to duffy and scrambled up to the edge of the dell even as the man turned to face crystal . 
2897 => no ! 
2898 => i called and pulled the crystal out of my pocket to throw at the man . 
2899 => it was the only weapon i had . 
2900 => there was a sudden gasp as he turned off balance . 
2901 => he raised a hand at me covering his face and fled into the darkness . 
2902 => why did you come up here ? 
2903 => you fool . 
2904 => you could have got hurt , crystal whispered hoarsely . 
2905 => i could tell she was angry with herself . 
2906 => dont be stupid . 
2907 => he was about to get you . 
2908 => its not me he wants . 
2909 => its you . 
2910 => how did you make him run anyway ? 
2911 => what have you got that scares him ? 
2912 => she asked . 
2913 => no idea , i lied . 
2914 => i guess he must have just decided to quit . 
2915 => i wonder who he was ? 
2916 => now , youre joking , crystal replied , incredulous . 
2917 => come on , lets get back . 
2918 => fifteen minutes later , crystal mounted pegasus and rode quietly up the bank and away . 
2919 => we waited in silence , leaning against a tree , for the horse to return . 
2920 => i was keeping a keen eye on the banks around the dell . 
2921 => there were no sounds to suggest anything was happening and duffy appeared completely casual and unconcerned . 
2922 => he was clearly used to it . 
2923 => i knew i could rely on duffy to be silent . 
2924 => he never spoke to anyone ; he simply smiled and looked . 
2925 => crystal and pegasus reappeared as quietly as they had gone and i was angry with myself that i had not heard them approaching . 
2926 => they gently and slowly came down the bank from the opposite direction . 
2927 => none of us spoke . 
2928 => duffy untied the bags that were hanging over the saddle of the horse and tied them all to a length of rope . 
2929 => together we dropped the rope , bag by bag , over the edge of the manhole and , while i took the strain of the six bulging pillowcases , duffy tied the rope to the top rung of the iron ladder that descended into the darkness . 
2930 => we eased the heavy lid gently back into place and duffy covered it with debris and moss from the dell . 
2931 => we accomplished all this without sound or light . 
2932 => duffy looked carefully around and then , with a brief wave and a pat on the back , walked off into the night . 
2933 => much would pass before i saw him again . 
2934 => i turned , fearing i would be left alone , but crystal was still there and mounted on the horse . 
2935 => she motioned to me to follow her and we walked off out of the pit in a different direction . 
2936 => there was still no sound or commotion . 
2937 => i started to say something but she quickly held her finger to her lips and we walked on in silence . 
2938 => the park was empty but the darkness and the trees waving their branches in the breeze gave it an eerie appearance . 
2939 => although the horse was quiet and placid , and the hooves made only a gentle clop on the turf , the sound of the horses breath seemed loud in the night . 
2940 => we reached the fence and stopped in the shadows of some trees . 
2941 => occasional couples walked by on a path outside the fence but they did not notice us . 
2942 => crystal leaned over and whispered in an even voice . 
2943 => harry , can you ride ? 
2944 => ive never tried , i replied , daring not think what would come next . 
2945 => climb on that bench and jump up behind me , she said . 
2946 => i cant do that , i whispered back . 
2947 => but crystal walked her horse to the bench in a determined way . 
2948 => i followed . 
2949 => there was little alternative . 
2950 => harry , she said again , if i told you the follower was still in the park and still following , would you try ? 
2951 => jump up and hold on to me . 
2952 => the great beast scared and worried me . 
2953 => i did not want to fall , but i did as she said and surprised myself by landing gently on the horses back behind crystal . 
2954 => pegasus shifted his ground and moved about a little but seemed unconcerned by the extra weight of a pillion . 
2955 => we started to move off into the night , back across the park and towards a different part of the city . 
2956 => the horse walked steadily for some minutes . 
2957 => the rhythm of the beast under me was unlike anything i had known before and i could feel the heat coming up through the deep coat . 
2958 => i held on to my rider around her waist , firmly at first , but with decreasing tension as the journey progressed . 
2959 => we came to the fence again and for a tense moment i wondered if the horse would try to jump it , but instead we found some broken railings by a fallen tree . 
2960 => the horse picked a way across and onto the path beyond . 
2961 => the journey back to the star chamber was one of the strangest i have ever known . 
2962 => the horse in the night time city seemed incongruous but also magical . 
2963 => many people stared up at us as we passed down the roads . 
2964 => in the distance behind we heard sirens and commotion and i guessed the crime was discovered . 
2965 => crystal was expert at piloting the beast and the streets were relatively quiet in the mid-evening lull . 
2966 => i closed my eyes and imagined travelling through the city in ancient times . 
2967 => the horses hooves were striking the road with a regular clip-clop of metal against stone , and the sound echoed from the walls as we passed . 
2968 => we travelled by back roads and footpaths for most of the way , crossing the larger roads from time to time . 
2969 => i think it was then that i fell under the spell of the proud and daring horse woman riding me to safety . 
2970 => are we going back ? 
2971 => i asked . 
2972 => we are and we are not , replied crystal cryptically and in a dreamy voice . 
2973 => harry , you are not safe in the big city . 
2974 => you have been seen and we are probably still being followed . 
2975 => i think we will be safe on the horse tonight , but they will be waiting for you . 
2976 => the star chamber is secure , but the follower will wait outside and you have to go out sometime . 
2977 => but what can i do ? 
2978 => i returned in an agitated whisper , looking all about for the follower . 
2979 => i , too , want to escape and return home . 
2980 => i am homesick , harry . 
2981 => there is nothing for me in this city . 
2982 => we are country folk , you and i . 
2983 => the city will never be our home , no matter how long we stay . 
2984 => do you trust me yet , harry ? 
2985 => i think so , i said . 
2986 => but i dont know who to believe , i continued . 
2987 => i have a plan , she said . 
2988 => i was going to go on my own , but it would be better with two . 
2989 => i have a way out of the city , which no follower will ever find . 
2990 => you must come with me . 
2991 => crystals voice was quiet but firm . 
2992 => she had made up her mind and mine . 
2993 => crystal seemed very quiet and contemplative as we progressed without a word passing between us . 
2994 => i felt enraptured in wonder at the city by night . 
2995 => the lights of thousands of houses and apartments concealed hundreds of thousands of lives , all moving together , like the myriad parts of some gigantic organism . 
2996 => in the distance , i could see an elevated freeway and it seemed that the lights of the cars as they pulsed along were like the lifeblood of the city and the roads were like arteries . 
2997 => we turned into a small road and a car turned in behind . 
2998 => suddenly , the car raced past . 
2999 => i could feel the horse tense beneath us . 
3000 => whoa , boy , crystal leaned over and stroked the beasts neck . 
3001 => the car squealed to stop just ahead of us as a second car came slowly up behind . 
3002 => it was trap . 
3003 => careful , harry . 
3004 => whatever you do stay on the horse , said crystal . 
3005 => by now , the two cars were completely blocking the street . 
3006 => a man emerged from each , leaving the doors open and the engines running . 
3007 => we stood stock still in the centre of the street . 
3008 => i could see pegasus ears switching around . 
3009 => but he stood his ground , motionless . 
3010 => itll be alright harry . 
3011 => well be fine . 
3012 => whatever you do , stay on board , whispered crystal . 
3013 => two men stood in the street light . 
3014 => one was tall and thin , the other short and fat . 
3015 => they both wore black leather jackets and dark glasses . 
3016 => the tall one stepped forward , still well back from the horse . 
3017 => he took a knife from his jacket and played with it . 
3018 => his friend did the same as they slowly came forward . 
3019 => oi you ! 
3020 => said the tall one in a voice i recognised . 
3021 => off the orse . 
3022 => not you missus , just im . 
3023 => we sat silent and still . 
3024 => you deaf kid ? 
3025 => get down ere or youll get some of this , he said , brandishing his knife . 
3026 => still we sat silent and motionless . 
3027 => i could feel the tension mounting in the horse below us . 
3028 => the beast was moving his head slowly from side to side watching the two . 
3029 => they moved in closer . 
3030 => the blades were bright and the glasses black . 
3031 => crystal tapped my hand : a signal . 
3032 => i tightened my grip . 
3033 => the horse was pawing its hooves as it shifted its weight . 
3034 => i wondered what we would do . 
3035 => i aint asking again . 
3036 => the kid gets down or you get this . 
3037 => crystal hit my hand firmly twice . 
3038 => i gripped her firmly . 
3039 => i could feel her heart thumping under her ribs . 
3040 => the horse could sense the moment . 
3041 => crystal tapped the horses flank with her heel and the beast sprang forward with a loud neighing . 
3042 => hold on harry ! 
3043 => i heard her shout . 
3044 => pegasus sprang forward with a shock of energy , straight at the tall man and knocked him down . 
3045 => the fat one was behind reaching out with his knife . 
3046 => the horse whinnied violently and i felt the back lift as he gave a mighty kick behind . 
3047 => the fat one screamed as we galloped past the cars and down the street . 
3048 => around the corner we stopped and crystal jumped down . 
3049 => our mount seemed agitated and was frothing at the bit , pawing the ground . 
3050 => crystal held his proud neck and stroked him . 
3051 => there , there , my beauty , my beauty . 
3052 => she went all around . 
3053 => there was a slight nick bleeding on his hindquarter . 
3054 => bastards , i heard her swear . 
3055 => she ran back to the corner just in time to see the two crawling back into their cars and turning back out of the street . 
3056 => a dozen windows were open and people looking out . 
3057 => at the far end of the street two men in dark suits stood and watched . 
3058 => she came back . 
3059 => gently , she remounted and we walked slowly and quietly . 
3060 => well be fine now , she said to me as we walked off slowly through a tangle of streets . 
3061 => this is one hell of a horse , i said . 
3062 => crystal laughed . 
3063 => this horse is not just any horse , harry . 
3064 => pegasus is a retired police horse . 
3065 => hes trained in riot control . 
3066 => thought he was back in the good old days . 
3067 => those two will think twice next time they see a horse coming towards them ! 
3068 => we did not go to the docks directly but rode to a low square building in the housing district , district five . 
3069 => crystal bade me to dismount and i slid off pegasus back gracelessly and landed roughly on the tarmac . 
3070 => crystal dropped lightly down to the ground beside me and led the horse up to the large wooden doors that led into the building . 
3071 => she rang a bell and after a while , a small , grizzled old man appeared . 
3072 => he looked suspiciously at me but then he took the horse silently . 
3073 => crystal handed the man a packet and whispered something pointing to the wound on the hind quarter . 
3074 => the old man ran his hands over him . 
3075 => then he turned without a word still glancing unsympathetically towards me . 
3076 => the man led the animal inside and crystal turned towards me and pointed down the road we were to follow . 
3077 => the evening was wearing on and we were still some miles from our destination , so we walked quickly . 
3078 => crystal seemed busy with her own thoughts and i remained silent , but the talk about the follower had made me wary and i looked out for shadows at every junction . 
3079 => after a mile , we passed into the quiet , lonely world of the shopping district at night . 
3080 => the contrast between the bright family-filled shops during the day and the night time squalor was startling . 
3081 => the dark doorways were home to drunks , dropouts and runaways who muttered oaths at us or shrank back into the shadows as we passed . 
3082 => crystal ignored them but i found them repulsive and filled with danger . 
3083 => dirty men with unintelligible slurs waved bottles and asked for money while sinister , silent , black shapes stayed huddled beneath old coats in their dark , squalid corners . 
3084 => where do these people live ? 
3085 => i asked . 
3086 => this is where they live , harry . 
3087 => dont stop , replied crystal . 
3088 => we walked on , trying not to look aside as we went . 
3089 => i saw a shadow emerge from a doorway ahead of us and stand in the darkness . 
3090 => crystal must have seen it too because she quickly crossed the road and we moved hurriedly on our way . 
3091 => the shadow figure turned and watched us as we went past . 
3092 => crystal walked briskly towards the main square ahead where there was more light . 
3093 => i glanced behind and saw the figure walking swiftly along the opposite pavement . 
3094 => is that the follower ? 
3095 => i whispered . 
3096 => no , i think not . 
3097 => its something else and i dont like it . 
3098 => we have to lose it before the 7th district . 
3099 => well be alone there . 
3100 => stick close behind and go exactly where i go , she replied , breathlessly as we increased our pace . 
3101 => a minute later , she darted into a small passageway and up a ramp into an empty car park . 
3102 => the car park was cavernous and filled with rows of pillars , walls , ramps and lift shafts . 
3103 => only a handful of cars were there . 
3104 => we dodged around and on to different levels as stealthily and quietly as we could , until crystal motioned me to stop . 
3105 => we crouched beside a parapet where we could view the entrance below . 
3106 => presently , a dark shadow crossed the threshold and entered the building . 
3107 => it looked about and stood very still for what seemed a long time . 
3108 => the light in the building was sparse but i caught a glimpse of the eyes as it looked towards us . 
3109 => i was terrified that it had seen us and felt compelled to stand up . 
3110 => crystal must have felt something of the same because she held her hand firmly down on my shoulder . 
3111 => the moment passed and the shadow figure turned back and left the building . 
3112 => the intensity of the encounter left us both feeling weak , but somehow i knew the danger was over , for the time being . 
3113 => do we go back down now ? 
3114 => i asked . 
3115 => no . 
3116 => wait for one minute longer , then get up , crystal whispered . 
3117 => the whir of a lift in the shaft behind us suddenly broke the silence . 
3118 => before we had time to move , the doors opened and out stepped a shadowy figure towards us and stopped . 
3119 => the silhouette was a sinister black shape against the light . 
3120 => my heart pumped erratically and a cold terror gripped me . 
3121 => i was unable to speak or move . 
3122 => crystal gripped my hand in hers as we crouched by the parapet . 
3123 => the lift doors shut and the figure stepped slowly forward into the light . 
3124 => he opened his mouth and relief flooded over me as muffy grinned at us . 
3125 => very friendly , he laughed looking at our clasped hands . 
3126 => i see you keep the wrong kind of company , he continued in a voice that sounded too loud . 
3127 => he walked to the parapet and looked over . 
3128 => two more figures emerged from the shadows as tuffy and puffy strolled into view . 
3129 => they waved and laughed . 
3130 => come on , lets go , someone called . 
3131 => the other members of the gang soon joined us . 
3132 => i felt a sudden great affection for them all as we jogged casually and confidently down the ramp and onto the street . 
3133 => the staring faces in the shop doorways no longer swore or begged . 
3134 => they stepped back in fear as the gang swept by . 
3135 => i began to realise that the down-and-outs respected and revered the big city gang . 
3136 => before we left the shopping district , tuffy turned and threw down a parcel in the street . 
3137 => he looked straight into my questioning face . 
3138 => theyll be fighting over that all night , he said and he laughed . 
3139 => the package contained some of the money from the casino raid . 
3140 => tuffy wanted to make sure that the news got back that it was the big city gang who had planned the robbery . 
3141 => in the distance , a figure stood alone and watching from the end of the street . 
3142 => we jogged on through the 7th district and the deserted factories . 
3143 => the high spirits were infectious and , before long , the gang song was ringing out from the warehouse walls . 
3144 => the singing died down to silence as we approached the labyrinth of tunnels and the stream of shadows slipped unseen into their hide-out and secured the doors behind them . 
3145 => we entered the star chamber as before and feasted for an hour . 
3146 => the gang told tales of their exploits . 
3147 => even i told of our ride home and the shadowy figures we had seen . 
3148 => crystal alone was quiet . 
3149 => as time went on i found i couldnt help looking at her . 
3150 => why was she so silent ? 
3151 => i was not the only one to notice . 
3152 => tuffy , too , kept darting looks at her and then at me . 
3153 => it was well into the early hours before we started to think of sleep . 
3154 => everyone felt tired when the gang split up to retire for the night . 
3155 => harry , lets go . 
3156 => ill show you where you can hole up for the night , said crystal . 
3157 => okay , i replied . 
3158 => hurry back crystal , called tuffy . 
3159 => i thought i saw him give me an unfriendly look as we left the room . 
3160 => i looked forward to a life on the streets with the impregnable big city gang . 
3161 => i foolishly thought that i was already a member . 
3162 => crystal led me down a maze of passages and into a small room . 
3163 => she stopped and spoke . 
3164 => harry , will you come with me ? 
3165 => i had , by then , forgotten her plan of escape . 
3166 => what , where ? 
3167 => i asked stupidly . 
3168 => home , of course , im going home , she replied sternly . 
3169 => now ! 
3170 => sometimes i wonder about you . 
3171 => you cant stay here . 
3172 => do you want to stay here without me to look after you ? 
3173 => think about it if you like , but im going now . 
3174 => she added . 
3175 => but how , and what about the follower and those other men ? 
3176 => i stammered . 
3177 => no-one will see us and by morning we will have left the big city . 
3178 => please come , i would like you to come , but we must go now . 
3179 => but i should be home - you could show me where to find the ferry and ill go . 
3180 => i was getting upset and confused . 
3181 => the big city gang would be , at best , uncomfortable without crystal and i began to realise that i , too , was away from home in a strange place . 
3182 => even crystal was strange . 
3183 => could i really trust her ? 
3184 => i suddenly had a crazy thought that if we left now for the ferry , then perhaps i could still get home before i was missed . 
3185 => no , harry . 
3186 => you idiot ! 
3187 => its gone 3.00am . 
3188 => if you so much as show your face up there in the middle of the night theyll find you and take you . 
3189 => theyre waiting for you . 
3190 => at least something is . 
3191 => and anyway , tuffys waiting for me and thats worse , and she caught my eye . 
3192 => think about it , harry . 
3193 => im a girl or didnt you notice ? 
3194 => she continued , but to herself , maybe not , maybe thats why i like you ? 
3195 => there was a moments silence . 
3196 => crystal tried again , gently but firmly this time . 
3197 => trust me , harry . 
3198 => we can help each other but we need to start right now . 
3199 => you said you couldnt trust someone you didnt know . 
3200 => well , youre wrong . 
3201 => i dont know you , but i know enough to trust you . 
3202 => i trust you , harry . 
3203 => this matters to me . 
3204 => a new insistent tone was in crystals voice . 
3205 => you matter to me . 
3206 => i could go on my own but i would be scared and lonely . 
3207 => come with me , now . 
3208 => i need you . 
3209 => this is my only chance and i really , really need you . 
3210 => crystal pushed back her hair and for the first time in minutes i could really see her face . 
3211 => her eyes were shining , damp . 
3212 => perhaps i am a little slow , a little dense sometimes . 
3213 => perhaps this was an experience too new . 
3214 => i stood stupidly , blinking at the floor . 
3215 => crystal reached out a hand and put it on my shoulder . 
3216 => she stood looking straight at my downcast eyes . 
3217 => i could not help myself , i had to look up and meet her own questioning eyes . 
3218 => from that moment , i had no choice and she knew she had won . 
3219 => i nodded my assent . 
3220 => with a beaming smile on her face , and to my total amazement , she hugged me , before we walked , both elated , into the twisting passages again . 
3221 => i began to recognise some of the places we had passed earlier in the day and , by the time we had reached the heavy bulkhead door , i realised that crystal meant to escape along the old underground river . 
3222 => we opened the door and went in . 
3223 => i saw the water , and the canoe was as we had left it . 
3224 => we heaved the heavy door shut and turned the bolt . 
3225 => it was pitch black within ; the sound of the water was loud and close in the deep dark surrounding us . 
3226 => well be all right once we are in the canoe , but we must do without the lights , said crystal . 
3227 => tuffy turns them off at bed time ! 
3228 => she added . 
3229 => i was still carrying my duffel bag , which i had not left for fear of losing it , and i triumphantly pulled out my small torch : the same one that i had taken to sgurr-cavan . 
3230 => even with a torch , getting into the canoe was a performance . 
3231 => but soon we were ready to cast off . 
3232 => a new adventure had begun . 
3233 => the river flowed against us but we made steady , if slow , progress upstream . 
3234 => we only used the torch sparingly to show the way ahead . 
3235 => it was hard to keep from scraping into the slimy walls . 
3236 => we were travelling under the city , on the uncharted waters of the ancient secret river . 
3237 => on and on we went , through the darkness towards our freedom . 
3238 => the splash of the paddles echoed from the roof . 
3239 => the water flowed almost silently about the slender craft as it moved . 
3240 => we passed unseen openings that we felt in the darkness . 
3241 => there , streams entered or weirs poured water off to other unknown places . 
3242 => there must have been hundreds of tunnels and drains down there . 
3243 => the evidence around us showed that craftsmen had built it . 
3244 => millions of bricks lined the tunnels and arches . 
3245 => once or twice , we glimpsed light where street lights shone through the cracks of a distant drain high above , but the river was a secret world . 
3246 => it belonged to us that night . 
3247 => we must follow the river right across the city and out through the marsh . 
3248 => if we stick to it , it will take us all the way home . 
3249 => but on the way there is a small job we have to do . 
3250 => crystal sounded a little different and there was a new assertiveness in her tone . 
3251 => she was the leader of the gang now . 
3252 => several hours passed and i felt very tired . 
3253 => the sound of the water and the rhythm of the paddling were lulling me into a dreamy wakefulness . 
3254 => suddenly , crystal lifted her paddle aboard and pulled the canoe over to a small landing stage . 
3255 => there , up there , shine the torch , she said in an excited voice . 
3256 => i pointed the beam up towards a slanting shaft that dropped down from the darkness and within it i could see , quite clearly , the form of six white pillowcases tied to a rope , hanging from a rusty ladder . 
3257 => chapter seven - secret river i scrambled up the sloping culvert . 
3258 => above me the pillowcases were hanging down in the dark . 
3259 => the old iron ladder was broken but sufficient remained to provide a footrest . 
3260 => the last of the cases dangled , almost out of reach , and i had to stretch out above the void to grab the rope and untie the end . 
3261 => i gripped the pillowcase and began to clamber down but the cotton snagged on a broken railing and the whole parcel of money fell from my hand and slithered down into the dark . 
3262 => look out below , i shouted and then i followed back down to the canoe . 
3263 => by the time i reached the bottom again , crystal was sitting , cross-legged in the canoe , with the grimy wet pillowcase in front of her . 
3264 => sorry ! 
3265 => i said and sat down again . 
3266 => crystal laughed and the echoes rebounded in choruses of happiness . 
3267 => what about the others ? 
3268 => i asked . 
3269 => i only take my fair share , she replied . 
3270 => they trust me , i respect them : thats how it works . 
3271 => we extracted the bags of money and stowed the haul in a dry sack from the front of the boat before we set off into the dark again . 
3272 => but the moneys stolen what if the police find us ? 
3273 => i asked . 
3274 => you heard tuffy . 
3275 => gambling is a bad habit . 
3276 => were just saving people from themselves . 
3277 => in any case , its only money . 
3278 => they make the money . 
3279 => they make the rules . 
3280 => but we dont have to play the game . 
3281 => anyway , the money isnt for me . 
3282 => the hands that had toiled to build the canal were forgotten but we felt we knew them from their work . 
3283 => i thought that they must have been a dignified and purposeful people . 
3284 => travelling through their tunnel was a strange experience . 
3285 => we were escaping and yet the tunnel held us captive within its dark subterranean universe . 
3286 => the black brick-lined tube seemed endless and remote from the living world . 
3287 => the loss of our sight enhanced our other senses : we became breeze detectives . 
3288 => temperature , smell and feeling filled our thoughts . 
3289 => despite the sounds around us , it was the most completely quiet place i had ever known . 
3290 => a peaceful reverence pervaded the tunnel and demanded a respectful silence . 
3291 => we learned to see with a worms eye view but , ever in the distance , we held the image of the pinprick of light , as yet unseen , that marked the entrance to the real world that lay beyond . 
3292 => the tunnel continued for many miles . 
3293 => we paddled at a regular pace deep into the night , resting occasionally , for the journey under the city was long and arduous . 
3294 => after such a long day , we both felt very sleepy . 
3295 => although we did not want to stop until we felt sure we were safe and free , tiredness overcame us . 
3296 => we found a railing , not far beyond the drain in the park , to which we could secure the canoe while we slept . 
3297 => the canoe was not good accommodation for two to sleep . 
3298 => not wide enough to sleep side by side and too short to be end to end . 
3299 => we covered ourselves as best as possible with our jackets and laid our heads on the sack of money in the centre of the canoe . 
3300 => good night harry , yawned crystal , and thanks . 
3301 => we both slept fitfully , and uncomfortably , curled up in the bottom of our boat . 
3302 => the water dripped constantly from the roof all around but , thankfully , little of it landed on us . 
3303 => the absolute darkness was unnerving and i found it impossible to measure the passage of time in the endless deep night of the tunnel . 
3304 => we woke up cold and hungry on sunday , in the lightless dawn of a false morning . 
3305 => crystal had planned her escape well and we had rations from the rat proof tin hidden in the bow . 
3306 => after a meagre snack , we set off again , moving through the darkness of the subterranean day . 
3307 => my back ached from a hard night in the canoe but it was good to be going again . 
3308 => the tunnel turned through a series of wide curves , first one way , then another . 
3309 => there were many other passages leading into the main channel and we moved in constant fear of losing our way or being swept over a weir . 
3310 => it was slow going and we had to guess the right way . 
3311 => twice we had to back out of dead ends . 
3312 => all through the day we hardly spoke but i never felt the need . 
3313 => often crystal would start to hum as we paddled along . 
3314 => once she started to sing but immediately stopped . 
3315 => go on , i said , i love to hear you sing . 
3316 => no , no , not yet . 
3317 => i wont sing until we are safe , until we are free . 
3318 => and so we paddled on in silence . 
3319 => it was early in the evening before we finally approached the tunnel entrance . 
3320 => the last few hundred yards of the tunnel had numerous junctions and the main channel sub-divided into two equal parts . 
3321 => after consulting the compass , we chose the left route and continued on our way . 
3322 => disturbingly , the tunnel seemed to be getting smaller until we had to duck to avoid hitting our heads . 
3323 => but we could smell a change in the air . 
3324 => there was something free infiltrating the close confines , a hint of freshness in the darkness . 
3325 => the ever lowering roof was disquieting and it was not until we emerged from the final bend that we saw a light in the distance . 
3326 => the last rosy flare of sunset reflected off the water and was creeping in through the hazy evening air . 
3327 => all thought of tiredness had dropped away from our cramped limbs and we paddled with renewed vigour . 
3328 => i felt a new excitement thrill through me as we piloted our canoe swiftly along . 
3329 => the pinpoint quickly grew to an inverted horseshoe shaped opening . 
3330 => the air in the gloom became fresher still and distant sounds penetrated the tunnel . 
3331 => the bright dynamics of the natural world released our blinkered , stifled senses . 
3332 => our small craft came to rest by a heavy and rusty iron grating that lay like a portcullis across the entrance . 
3333 => we peered out through the bars that imprisoned us and my heart sank . 
3334 => now what do we do ? 
3335 => i asked . 
3336 => dont worry , there will be a way out , crystal replied . 
3337 => lets see what we can see first . 
3338 => there was a vast empty mistiness outside that covered a marsh . 
3339 => it filled the air as far we could see . 
3340 => as we watched , the evening sun dipped to the horizon far to the right , through clouds that looked like mountains . 
3341 => there was no sign of human habitation , but there was ample wildlife ; the raucous calls of ducks and geese , great billowing clouds of gnats and mosquitoes , and the occasional plop of a rat entering water filled the air ahead . 
3342 => the night descended quickly across the marshes and we were in darkness once more . 
3343 => we should sleep now , said crystal . 
3344 => at least this will be a safe place to stay for tonight . 
3345 => i could see that it was safe ; perhaps it was too safe . 
3346 => how could we break through the barrier ahead ? 
3347 => but we were tired and we tied up the canoe inside the grating . 
3348 => we lay as best we could beneath our coats in the cool dark . 
3349 => sleep soon overcame the discomfort and the big city filled my dreams . 
3350 => i awoke with a start . 
3351 => i looked nervously around and expected to see the familiar surroundings of my bedroom . 
3352 => where was i ? 
3353 => i slowly recalled the previous night but , disturbingly , the canoe was no longer at the tunnel entrance and crystal was nowhere about . 
3354 => i was alone . 
3355 => my first thought was : shes abandoned me . 
3356 => shes left me . 
3357 => i felt a slight panic as the thought hit me . 
3358 => then i settled . 
3359 => no , she would not have done that . 
3360 => but where was she and where was i ? 
3361 => used to the dark after our days of perpetual night , i could make out the outline of the tunnel and could tell that this was some kind of junction with several other tunnels leading off in different directions . 
3362 => i felt about for my torch , but it was gone . 
3363 => crystal must have taken it . 
3364 => i settled down to wait . 
3365 => there was little else i could do . 
3366 => trust me , she had said . 
3367 => now was the time for trust . 
3368 => i could hear a strange noise in the distance and it was coming nearer . 
3369 => it sounded like a high pitched wind and whatever it was , it was heading towards me . 
3370 => suddenly a black shadow shot overhead , then another and another . 
3371 => i dropped to floor of the canoe . 
3372 => the rushing noise turned into a squealing screech as hoards of bats flew overhead . 
3373 => the air was thick with the creatures . 
3374 => they flew inches from my head and filled the whole tunnel . 
3375 => there must have been thousands of the tiny mammals . 
3376 => the air was solid black . 
3377 => the noise was deafening . 
3378 => the animals started landing on me where i crouched in the canoe . 
3379 => i could feel them in my hair . 
3380 => i was enveloped by hundreds of tiny bats , flapping and squealing . 
3381 => i tried to beat them off but they were crawling over my arms and face and biting my hands . 
3382 => their claws were razor sharp on my hands and scalp . 
3383 => it was hard to breathe and the air stank . 
3384 => more and more came and crowded all around me . 
3385 => there were too many and some had their tiny talons in my cheeks . 
3386 => i dared not open my eyes . 
3387 => i could not open my mouth to shout for help . 
3388 => in the panic of the moment i had to do something . 
3389 => i tried to stand up but the mass of bats made it impossible . 
3390 => i did the only thing i could think of and tumbled out of the canoe into the river and submerged myself completely . 
3391 => the bats dropped off me in a mad confusion . 
3392 => i stayed under as long as i could hold my breath and then emerged gasping . 
3393 => to my horror , i was immediately attacked . 
3394 => ducking under i waded half waddling down the tunnel . 
3395 => every few seconds i put my head out for a breath . 
3396 => each time there were still bats , but fewer and fewer . 
3397 => then i stood up and walked , half running down the tunnel , turning and twisting through a dozen junctions until i was surrounded by silence . 
3398 => i stood dripping in the inky black . 
3399 => the bats had gone and i was completely lost . 
3400 => i found the edge of the tunnel , slimy with weed and slowly made my way back to the first junction . 
3401 => i could discern at least three other ways out . 
3402 => crystal , crystal , where are you ? 
3403 => i said out loud . 
3404 => it sounded so loud that my voice turned to a whisper as fear overtook me . 
3405 => i stood silently . 
3406 => it was completely dark but i could feel the water moving past my legs . 
3407 => of course , of course . 
3408 => just follow the flow . 
3409 => i started walking on and at every junction i stopped still until i could feel the water flowing past . 
3410 => a few minutes later i came to large tunnel junction . 
3411 => i was sure i was back in the main tunnel . 
3412 => i followed the walls until i came to a ledge and suddenly cracked my shins on the canoe . 
3413 => dim light could be seen reflecting off the water in the far distance . 
3414 => suddenly it was blotted out . 
3415 => involuntarily i tensed in expectation . 
3416 => but no noise followed . 
3417 => i moved all the dry things in the canoe out of the way and climbed dripping onto the thwart . 
3418 => there was a long passageway beside me leading off at a tangent from the main channel but still wide enough to take the canoe . 
3419 => i was ready to loosen the painter and paddle round out of sight . 
3420 => a minute later , after i had soothed my stiff limbs , i saw the shadowy shape of crystal wading through the water towards me . 
3421 => getting closer she turned on the torch . 
3422 => she carried her trousers draped over her shoulder . 
3423 => chrissy , over here , i whispered . 
3424 => her welcoming smile dropped when she saw me . 
3425 => whatevers happened to you ? 
3426 => you look like youve fallen out of the boat . 
3427 => are you all right ? 
3428 => im fine , i lied , just had a bit of a surprise . 
3429 => she shone the torch on my face and gasped . 
3430 => harry ! 
3431 => youre hurt . 
3432 => i didnt know it but my face was covered in blood from the bats attack . 
3433 => bats , i explained , what about you ? 
3434 => ive been busy . 
3435 => its all right , ive found a way out , she announced . 
3436 => she threw her clothes into the canoe and then climbed in herself , dripping wet . 
3437 => come on , sleepy head , she said , this way , well be out in a minute . 
3438 => then we can sort you out . 
3439 => i should never have left you . 
3440 => we paddled up the small tunnel . 
3441 => the roof was so low that we had to duck and the walls were so close that there was barely room to swing the paddle round but the entrance soon appeared ahead of us , and it was open . 
3442 => we glided through into the morning sun , between two high banks of reeds and marsh flowers . 
3443 => as we emerged , an otter sitting on the bank watched us bemusedly . 
3444 => i need this . 
3445 => boy do i need this . 
3446 => daylight at last , i said . 
3447 => i wanted to smile but the pain of my face stopped me . 
3448 => youre soaked through . 
3449 => over to the bank and sit there for a bit in the sun while i clean you up . 
3450 => crystal played mother , while i played the little boy . 
3451 => she knelt beside me . 
3452 => bit by bit she used her handkerchief to clean my face , gently washing off the blood with water from the stream . 
3453 => as she did so , i watched her eyes only inches from mine . 
3454 => dont , she whispered , catching me with a direct glance youre distracting me . 
3455 => sorry , i mumbled and looked away , blushing . 
3456 => there , she smiled , it looked worse than it was . 
3457 => the perimeter of the big city airport lay out of sight on its man-made plateau . 
3458 => the terminal was already coming noisily to life a mile behind us . 
3459 => do we leave the canoe here ? 
3460 => i asked . 
3461 => this stream seems to be very shallow . 
3462 => the keel was scraping the soft muddy bottom of the silted channel as we came through . 
3463 => no , replied crystal . 
3464 => well walk , but we cant walk through the marsh . 
3465 => what then ? 
3466 => well get out , but we will keep the canoe for our things and for sleeping . 
3467 => without us weighing it down it should float fine and we can walk up the river bed , or along the bank . 
3468 => remember , this is not the main channel . 
3469 => if we can rejoin it we may be able to paddle again . 
3470 => do you know where we are going ? 
3471 => i asked , looking around . 
3472 => the marsh was covered in mist that seemed to form a white wall in the distance . 
3473 => crystal didnt reply immediately but gazed into the mist . 
3474 => she pointed vaguely ahead and said quietly : over there , thats home . 
3475 => for you , but not for me , i replied sadly . 
3476 => i dont think ill ever get home . 
3477 => but crystal did not seem to hear me . 
3478 => she was still looking across the marsh . 
3479 => i looked into the mist again but saw nothing across the blanket of white . 
3480 => so i turned my attention to the immediate need . 
3481 => what can we eat ? 
3482 => i asked and then answered my own question . 
3483 => look at all those fish in the shadows ! 
3484 => they wont bite us , will they ? 
3485 => no . 
3486 => well bite them , laughed crystal . 
3487 => lets eat fish ! 
3488 => well have to catch them first , i observed . 
3489 => dont move . 
3490 => stay absolutely still , she replied . 
3491 => crystal stood in the water watching and waiting . 
3492 => slowly , she crouched down , close to the bank and stayed motionless ; a bare legged statue . 
3493 => her concentration on her task seemed to be total . 
3494 => i looked on , fascinated and entranced . 
3495 => she was in communion with nature . 
3496 => it was a moment of discovery for me . 
3497 => this strange girl was at once selfless and nave , yet full of knowledge and experience . 
3498 => in that moment , i felt a warmth inside me that i had known before . 
3499 => i knew i was with a friend , a new friend and it seemed almost dreamlike to me , to be there alone with this magical girl . 
3500 => the fish moved through the shadows by the river bank and hung in the current , drifting into crystals shadow . 
3501 => her hands were in the water . 
3502 => very gently , crystal stroked the bodies of two large trout that sheltered in her shade . 
3503 => with the smallest rhythmical movements she seemed to entrance the fish into submission . 
3504 => she was completely involved in her task . 
3505 => suddenly , and without warning , it was over . 
3506 => she had caught the two trout and landed them on the bank . 
3507 => the gleaming , silvery fish were both stunned on the gunwale and crystal took out her knife and headed towards the tunnel . 
3508 => using a brick wall as a workbench she gutted and beheaded the fish . 
3509 => youve done that before , i can see . 
3510 => come on , she called , bring the canoe . 
3511 => i took the rope and followed her back into the shadows . 
3512 => blinded by the dark of the tunnel , i hung back by the entrance for a minute . 
3513 => i tied up the canoe and , under orders from crystal , i went back out to find sufficient dry material for a small fire . 
3514 => i used my knife to good effect and returned to the tunnel with an armful of reeds and rushes , together with two pieces of driftwood that i found caught up on the riverbank . 
3515 => crystal pulled a tin out of the bottom of the canoe while i made up the fire on a ledge . 
3516 => the matches had thankfully not been in my pocket when i went under the water . 
3517 => we were still within sight of the entrance where two tunnels branched . 
3518 => the flickering light spread ghastly shadows across the old brickwork and the fire smoked somewhat . 
3519 => each fish was skewered on two sticks and held over the flames . 
3520 => i was pleased of the warmth in my wet clothes . 
3521 => but we quickly doused the flames when the fish had cooked . 
3522 => we sat at the edge of the tunnel to eat our meal . 
3523 => the food was rudimentary but satisfying . 
3524 => the tunnel flues had drawn the smoke into the darkness and we hoped that it would disperse before it emerged . 
3525 => we returned with the canoe to the daylight cautiously and started to walk up the river . 
3526 => crystal was in front but she turned and gave me an odd look and then laughed . 
3527 => silly harry ! 
3528 => she said still looking at me , you cant walk in the river like that . 
3529 => youll need dry clothes to sleep in tonight . 
3530 => i could feel myself blushing once more . 
3531 => i had been dreading this moment . 
3532 => its all right , she smiled . 
3533 => ill look the other way . 
3534 => i knew she was right . 
3535 => i wrung out my sodden socks and trousers and draped them in the canoe to dry in the sun . 
3536 => i felt like me again and i began to enjoy my adventure . 
3537 => there was a grey smoky pall that hung above the big city behind us . 
3538 => it was a mixture of mist and pollution that made up that peculiar atmosphere , and which seemed somehow apt . 
3539 => we both felt secure in the marsh where we were practically invisible in the vastness of our surroundings . 
3540 => there were no roads near the place and , with luck , our long passage through the secret river tunnel had deadened the scent for any followers that might have attempted to find us . 
3541 => the late summer sun kept us warm in our watery surroundings . 
3542 => my clothes soon dried and we made reasonable progress . 
3543 => even if we were seen , there was no reason we should attract any special attention . 
3544 => the edge of the airport soon became just a noisy blot amongst the general haze behind us . 
3545 => ahead , the air cleared and by midday we could see across to the far side of the marsh into the distance beyond . 
3546 => the firm banks of the stream receded back and high reed beds surrounded us on either side making our progress invisible to all , except from the air . 
3547 => down at water level , it was a small private world . 
3548 => the stream we were walking along seemed to keep , more or less , on a course for the far side of the marsh , albeit not in a straight path . 
3549 => fortunately , crystal seemed to be in her element among the reed beds and walked ahead , reading the way with precision . 
3550 => our side stream joined the main river and i heard crystal sigh as she stood and looked at the scene . 
3551 => the water channel seemed half empty . 
3552 => we would not be able to row our canoe after all . 
3553 => damn the dam , she hissed . 
3554 => the further we progressed along the old river , the narrower the channel snaking down the old broad river bed became . 
3555 => a gradual change took place in our surroundings and the reeds on either side gave way to tussocky humps that protruded from the boggy brown peat . 
3556 => cotton grass waved its white fluffy heads at the waters edge and occasional half-fallen alder trees attempted to grow in the stonier places . 
3557 => the river widened a little where the marsh gave way to firmer ground and the water channelled into rivulets with low banks . 
3558 => our way led us to a sparse woodland of crack willows . 
3559 => they stood , twisted , gnarled and ancient , half-leaning , half-fallen in the swamp . 
3560 => we stopped in their shade . 
3561 => the evening was approaching and the water was becoming too cold on our bare legs for us to walk in the river for much longer . 
3562 => we tied up the canoe and made camp for the night on some firm ground , in among the trees . 
3563 => some ducks eggs and sorrel leaves that crystal had collected earlier in the day extended our fishy diet . 
3564 => we did not cook our meal until the evening mist had started to descend to hide the smoke from our fire . 
3565 => while we ate , a glorious sunset flooded the misty skies with crimson and gold . 
3566 => we looked on and quietly talked . 
3567 => how much further do we have to go before we get somewhere ? 
3568 => i asked . 
3569 => i think we will reach the high ground beyond the marsh some time tomorrow . 
3570 => what then ? 
3571 => we keep going . 
3572 => we should be home in two days at most , if we stick at it . 
3573 => this rivers not getting any deeper . 
3574 => we will have to leave the canoe soon . 
3575 => we should sort our things , i suggested , and get rid of anything we dont need . 
3576 => okay . 
3577 => we dont have much but we wont want to carry all of it . 
3578 => we emptied the contents of our bags into the bottom of the canoe and removed the unwanted items . 
3579 => by the time we had finished , we had made room for the money , that had been in the pillowcase , to be spread through our other luggage . 
3580 => we each had a modest backpack and crystal also had a small holdall she had placed in the canoe in preparation for her journey . 
3581 => we tested the weight of our luggage and decided that we had done enough . 
3582 => there was a pile of oddments , which we needed to throw out , left heaped in the bottom of the canoe . 
3583 => i picked up a neat , well made wooden box , that crystal had put there . 
3584 => oh , thats not to go , she cried . 
3585 => give it here ! 
3586 => so saying , she grabbed the box from me . 
3587 => im sorry , crystal , i said . 
3588 => its just that , well , ive got a box just like that at home . 
3589 => oh , really , she said indignantly , well , this is mine . 
3590 => the one i have doesnt really belong to me , i explained . 
3591 => my father gave it to me . 
3592 => i use it to keep something in . 
3593 => whats in yours ? 
3594 => my mother gave it to me . 
3595 => its very , very old . 
3596 => i put my hand in my jacket pocket and looked at her steadily . 
3597 => crystal , this is important , i said . 
3598 => you told me to get rid of whatever i had that the followers wanted back in the big city . 
3599 => well i didnt . 
3600 => ive got it here . 
3601 => if i show you what i keep in my box , then will you show me whats inside yours ? 
3602 => maybe , she replied . 
3603 => you see , it wasnt the box i recognised , it was that mark on the lid , that funny star . 
3604 => its not a star , she replied . 
3605 => its the sign of the double-cross . 
3606 => i took the white crystal from my pocket where it lay concealed in the small leather pouch and unwrapped it . 
3607 => it was almost dark by then but the brilliant stone reflected a glimmer of light and shone out . 
3608 => crystal caught her breath and stared at the precious stone . 
3609 => slowly , she opened her box and unwrapped the item inside . 
3610 => she placed her hand beside mine and a second crystal glowed : two stars in the deepening mists . 
3611 => we both looked at them for a long time in the growing dark . 
3612 => suddenly i had a thought . 
3613 => crystal , take this stone and place it beside yours . 
3614 => the stones lay in her hand . 
3615 => i moved them together and , as if by magic , the two stones became one ; they fitted together seamlessly ; they must have been crystals from the same rock . 
3616 => we both looked into her palm where the newly united stones glinted like jewels . 
3617 => do you know what these stones are ? 
3618 => i asked quietly as i took her hand in mine and gently separated the crystals . 
3619 => i lifted my crystal and returned it to its hiding place . 
3620 => yes , she quavered , well i think so . 
3621 => theyre special stones , like a talisman . 
3622 => my mother told me it was special ; she said to keep it safe , always . 
3623 => she was right , but they are more than special : they are magic . 
3624 => do you believe in magic ? 
3625 => i dont know , she replied . 
3626 => this is magic , i said , us meeting , coming here , going where were going . 
3627 => no chance in million years could have brought us together with these white crystals . 
3628 => we dont need to think about it , it is . 
3629 => perhaps , said crystal dreamily . 
3630 => who knows . 
3631 => chance is a strange thing . 
3632 => but i think we should sleep now . 
3633 => im tired and its dark , and theres still a long way to go tomorrow . 
3634 => on tuesday morning , our journey continued through the marshes . 
3635 => we were both becoming weary of the watery wilderness that surrounded us . 
3636 => we needed shelter and good food . 
3637 => we found it difficult to walk through the soft ground and muddy streambeds , and we felt tired . 
3638 => as the water channels grew smaller , we often had to heave the canoe through the reeds or over banks of coarse grass . 
3639 => the air in the marshes was humming with insects that constantly surrounded us and got into our hair , and mouth and eyes . 
3640 => i think well call this place the midge marsh , joked crystal , as she waved her hand at the clouds of insects that surrounded us . 
3641 => the swarms of mosquitoes left us sore and itching . 
3642 => dank pools of water bubbled on either side of the fresh water streams and foul marsh gas filled the air with a loathsome stench . 
3643 => at one point , we stumbled into a nest of water snakes . 
3644 => the sinister creatures slid off in all directions as we jumped into the canoe for safety . 
3645 => we kept a wary eye open for any more marsh creatures as we ventured forth again . 
3646 => i dont like this much , i admitted . 
3647 => something here makes me uneasy . 
3648 => cant you feel it ? 
3649 => yes , me too . 
3650 => something up ahead . 
3651 => i think theres something waiting up there . 
3652 => dont know what . 
3653 => were heading towards it , but its the only way we can go . 
3654 => sooner we reach those woods the better , i replied . 
3655 => we can take cover there . 
3656 => on tuesday night , we slept in the canoe for the last time . 
3657 => for safety , we moored it in the centre of the small river , for once broadened into a substantial pond by a barrier of silt . 
3658 => the air was much colder than on previous nights but we managed well enough . 
3659 => we had become used to our hard , cramped sleeping quarters and both slept well . 
3660 => we awoke early on wednesday morning , to the sound and sensation of falling rain . 
3661 => a few feet from the canoe , a heron stood with one foot in the water and a quizzical expression on its face . 
3662 => the great bird flapped its wings awkwardly and slowly ascended to fly away south . 
3663 => we were both damp and cold , so we decided to proceed without breakfast until we could find shelter . 
3664 => the days journey began . 
3665 => we paddled to the edge of the pond and walked through the relative cover , but sometimes difficult terrain , of sparse woodland . 
3666 => i began to see sandstone and shale in the banks on either side where they lay in miniature cliffs and terraces that rose up to firmer ground . 
3667 => twice , i glimpsed the iridescent flash of a kingfisher , flying from a hole in a bank . 
3668 => by midday , the woodland had closed to a forest of oak and beech and the marshland was behind us . 
3669 => the river spread out to a shallow stony brook just a few inches deep and the time had come to let the canoe go . 
3670 => we carried it to a deep pool beneath a small waterfall and filled it with stones and water until it sank . 
3671 => we were sad to leave it behind ; it had been a good home . 
3672 => gathering our packs , we walked up through the woods to the top of a small rocky hill from where we could view the land about . 
3673 => fortunately , the rain had stopped and the air was clear . 
3674 => it surprised me that i could no longer see the big city in the distance behind . 
3675 => even the marsh beyond the woodland was indistinct . 
3676 => we knew we would encounter signs of human habitation again somewhere ahead of us and we planned to buy some wholesome food as soon as we could . 
3677 => there was a well-trodden path up the hill that led towards a road and that meant there must be a village or town somewhere in the distance . 
3678 => i passed the time while we were walking along the path by telling crystal something of the legend of mythras , but i did not include the story of my own crystal or of my journey across the water . 
3679 => eventually , we saw roofs in the distance . 
3680 => we struck out across the heathland towards the settlement . 
3681 => we finally walked into the main square of a small town , in the late afternoon . 
3682 => we were both tired and hungry . 
3683 => the place was a small , attractive market town , and ideal for our purpose . 
3684 => it appeared to be a holiday destination for big city folk and there were a few sightseers walking about . 
3685 => we had already decided to pose as hikers on holiday , if the need arose . 
3686 => we bought a map and some snacks from a small shop and found a quiet place to rest and eat . 
3687 => the money from the pillowcase was much more than we had expected , but crystal did not intend to use any of the ill-gotten windfall on our journey . 
3688 => she said it would be too dangerous . 
3689 => instead , she had a small sum of her own , some of which we used to buy food . 
3690 => we went to a camping shop and used the last of crystals money to buy a tiny inconspicuous tent . 
3691 => we then set off to find shelter for the night . 
3692 => we decided that woodland would be the best place to stay and we located a forest area on our map . 
3693 => it was on a hill some miles above the town and appeared to provide perfect cover . 
3694 => carrying our heavy loads slowed our passage , but eating a wholesome meal had improved our spirits and renewed our strength . 
3695 => the evening was beautiful and we were happy to take time to reach our destination . 
3696 => we came to a steep valley , deep in the woods , where there was a grove of ancient yew trees . 
3697 => it was very quiet and even sullen . 
3698 => there was no bird song in the place and the silence was so complete that it was intimidating and made us whisper . 
3699 => the dark vale was not ordinarily inviting but fulfilled our wish for a quiet undisturbed halt for the night . 
3700 => our presence there would be almost invisible even from within the coomb . 
3701 => at the bottom of the wood there was a small clearing where we made our camp beside a stream . 
3702 => we decided not to light any fires , having already eaten , but to go directly to sleep and rise at first light in the morning and get a long days travelling under our belts once we were refreshed . 
3703 => inside the tent , we could shut out the mournful gloom of the silent valley and before long we fell into a restless sleep . 
3704 => several times i awoke to the sound of animals moving outside . 
3705 => i heard the rustling leaves and quiet snuffling sounds as the creatures of the night searched for food . 
3706 => in that sombre quiet even the clicking of beetles in the undergrowth seemed loud . 
3707 => i felt tense as i lay listening to the night . 
3708 => the deep black darkness was so dense that i felt it was crushing me . 
3709 => it was somehow more sinister than the tunnels had been . 
3710 => i drifted back into an uneasy sleep . 
3711 => crystal woke up in the early hours and awakened me . 
3712 => it was not yet light but something about her manner seemed agitated and there was urgency in her voice . 
3713 => i dont like this place , she whispered . 
3714 => lets up and go . 
3715 => i dont like it either . 
3716 => i replied . 
3717 => its eerie . 
3718 => silently , we gathered our belongings . 
3719 => we did not use the torch . 
3720 => suddenly , in the distance , we heard a strange noise . 
3721 => we both stopped stock still and waited but there was silence . 
3722 => it could have been an animal or maybe not . 
3723 => it chilled us both . 
3724 => lets leave the tent . 
3725 => well collect it later . 
3726 => i whispered . 
3727 => i slid out into the dark and crystal handed out our bags . 
3728 => i cautiously crept behind a nearby bush . 
3729 => the air was tense and too still , as though a storm might be approaching . 
3730 => crystal followed and we flitted bush by bush and tree by tree back up to the head of the small coomb . 
3731 => it was too dark in the valley to see anything , but along the ridge of the hill the night sky showed as a lighter grey behind the silhouettes of the trees . 
3732 => we crouched very still and looked all around for several slow silent minutes . 
3733 => the feeling of unease persisted , but it felt better out in the open where we would not be surprised . 
3734 => the strange sound came again , something like the howl of a vixen , closer this time . 
3735 => suddenly , we saw them : two strange shadows on the top of the hill . 
3736 => they stood quite still . 
3737 => they seemed to be sniffing the air . 
3738 => i nearly stopped breathing . 
3739 => they stood only a few hundred yards away and they were looking down into the valley . 
3740 => they moved and then disappeared . 
3741 => i almost panicked but i stood my ground . 
3742 => i could hear a faint movement below , in the dark , and then all went quiet for a moment . 
3743 => a second later , there was a distant metallic scratching sound followed quickly by a blaze of fire . 
3744 => they had set the tent alight and the valley filled with a furious but brief inferno . 
3745 => we watched the two daemonic figures dancing round the blazing tent . 
3746 => the flames spread their ghoulish shadows over the trees and the strange animal cries echoed through the woods , triumphant and loud . 
3747 => it was ghastly but enchanting . 
3748 => crystal tugged my hand and we ran , as fast as we could , away from the terror . 
3749 => we bounded through the undergrowth dragging our packs along with us . 
3750 => the twigs snapped at us and brambles scratched our faces and hands , but still we kept running . 
3751 => we saw the pale light of a clearing ahead and we stopped still , standing with heaving breath and pounding hearts . 
3752 => there was a forest road in front of us bounded by a high laurel hedge . 
3753 => behind us , all was now silent . 
3754 => we crawled into the hedge and were hidden . 
3755 => lets wait here til daybreak , i whispered hoarsely . 
3756 => i took crystals hand and felt it was hot and trembling . 
3757 => i pulled her gently to the ground and we sat down back to back inside the hedge and waited and waited . 
3758 => time passed slowly . 
3759 => we saw no one except the shadows of the trees and we heard nothing but the wind in the branches . 
3760 => the dawn showed grey in the sky and the frightening events of the night seemed to fade away into dreams . 
3761 => i cant stay here any longer , im freezing . 
3762 => lets go , said crystal suddenly . 
3763 => okay . 
3764 => well be safe now its getting light . 
3765 => a small confidence had returned with the sun and we stood up and stepped out onto the dirt road to continue our journey . 
3766 => immediately we walked out there was a sudden noise behind us : the awful call of the strange men . 
3767 => we saw them at the edge of the woodland track . 
3768 => they started to run towards us and we ran too , but it was no use . 
3769 => oh , harry ! 
3770 => theyre going to catch us , cried crystal . 
3771 => well have to fight them , i shouted back . 
3772 => make a stand . 
3773 => we stopped , turned and stood together , panting . 
3774 => i felt for crystals hand . 
3775 => they were around fifty yards away . 
3776 => we dropped our packs and faced them as they raced towards us . 
3777 => they wore tattered black robes and carried long poles . 
3778 => deep hoods shaded their faces . 
3779 => we stood gripping each others hand . 
3780 => wait til they get close and , when i say , run round , one each side . 
3781 => i said in a trembling voice . 
3782 => just twenty feet to go and i opened my mouth to shout , now ! 
3783 => suddenly , they stopped . 
3784 => there was absolute silence . 
3785 => we stood shivering with fear but resolute , and they stood a few yards away with poles raised to strike . 
3786 => i could feel tears of terror rising in my eyes . 
3787 => crystals hand gripped mine resolutely . 
3788 => in the silence i heard the blood pumping through my head . 
3789 => but something had changed them ; they turned quickly and fled back down the road like a pair of frightened dogs . 
3790 => we looked at each other , confused and wondering . 
3791 => spontaneously we hugged each other with relief but dare not turn away . 
3792 => oh , crystal ! 
3793 => i thought we were going to die . 
3794 => or worse , she replied . 
3795 => why did they go ? 
3796 => i dont know , but lets get out of here before they return . 
3797 => again , we picked up our packs and turned to walk on but stopped still where we stood . 
3798 => on the path fifty paces behind us stood two large horses surmounted by two riders who looked sternly down . 
3799 => the finely dressed horsemen wore uniforms of gold and deep green . 
3800 => the chestnut horses wore silken gold and green cloths beneath their saddles . 
3801 => the cloths bore the symbol of the double-cross . 
3802 => what now ? 
3803 => i whispered . 
3804 => is this good or bad ? 
3805 => look , the double-cross , crystal whispered back . 
3806 => the riders approached slowly . 
3807 => the gold horseman spoke clearly in a deep , steady voice , so , we have found you , and just in time . 
3808 => who are you ? 
3809 => i asked shakily . 
3810 => we are lords of the double-cross , spoke the emerald lord , and we have an interest in the prize you carry with you . 
3811 => you will be safe with us , said his companion , the gold lord . 
3812 => follow us now , from this place , before your unwanted friends return . 
3813 => so saying , he turned his horse about and walked slowly away . 
3814 => crystal looked at me . 
3815 => they seem to know a lot , she whispered . 
3816 => well have to go , i replied resignedly . 
3817 => at least they look civilised , if somewhat out of our time . 
3818 => i feel like ive walked into some medieval dream . 
3819 => the emerald lord dismounted and signalled to me to walk ahead of him . 
3820 => he bade crystal to ride in the saddle as he took the reins to lead the great horse on . 
3821 => you know how to handle even this great horse , i think . 
3822 => there was little alternative but to do as requested by these strange folk . 
3823 => the terror of the night was still fresh in my mind and here seemed , at least , to be a safe passage away from our unknown aggressors . 
3824 => the size and strength of the horses and the bearing of the men bred confidence and security . 
3825 => also , there was a fascination . 
3826 => who were these people ? 
3827 => how did they know where we were ? 
3828 => what was the significance of the double-cross ? 
3829 => where would they take us ? 
3830 => all of these questions filled my mind in the minutes after we met the horsemen . 
3831 => our small band on the forest track seemed mysteriously ancient . 
3832 => the silence of the woods removed all thoughts of modern life from my mind . 
3833 => the noble horses and finely dressed lords all walking together along the mossy way , surrounded by the dripping misty trees , were like a picture from a romantic childhood story . 
3834 => the fluting lazy late summer song of the birds combined with the earthy smell of approaching autumn in the air to lead us into a dream-like unreality . 
3835 => we accepted our new companions as saviours from we knew not what . 
3836 => i had the strange feeling that there was some larger play being enacted of which i was just a part . 
3837 => yet i had also become aware that this step into a new history was also linked to the magic of mythras and the white crystal . 
3838 => it seemed as if we were travelling backward through time into an old and different future . 
3839 => i looked about me at the passing trees and they almost seemed to be watching us . 
3840 => the emerald lord caught my eye and began to recite a poem . 
3841 => his deep bass voice was as reassuring as the words were beautiful . 
3842 => in the forest reach for me a fine tree and hold it in your eye . 
3843 => dark and free , a pine tree : sharp silhouette against the sky . 
3844 => the wind plays with breezes on the branches while the sun ignites their colours with fiery glances . 
3845 => luxuries of beech woods fill the earth up to the sky . 
3846 => like chameleons of the seasons , their fables filled with reasons ; they are the truth , they never lie . 
3847 => but when the winter freezes , cold and ghostly skeletons haunt the forest floor . 
3848 => despite that death exterior , their hearts are warm with life suspended in the core ; the voices whisper sleeping where in their dreams is time just barely creeping . 
3849 => on this late summer morning i see the leaves making patterns in my mind : an ecstasy of movement , shivering pictures of liquid beauty , shattered mirrors sharpened splinters like icicles of forgotten winters now warmly dancing in the sky . 
3850 => come reach with me so fine a tree , natures glory in your eye . 
3851 => i love the words and i see you love the words also , he said and then the emerald lord fell silent . 
3852 => it was true that something about the poem had filled me with a new hope . 
3853 => only a good man and true would hold such things sacred . 
3854 => the party moved on ahead steadily and quietly , accompanied by the soft footfall of the horses hooves in the leaf mould and the forest sounds of bird , wind and stream . 
3855 => the path took us upwards towards the hilly crown of the woods . 
3856 => in my reverie , i walked contentedly . 
3857 => it seemed to me that reality had become a dream . 
3858 => within me , i felt these men could be trusted , at least for now . 
3859 => after a while , crystal spoke . 
3860 => where are we going ? 
3861 => to a safe place . 
3862 => you must know that you have inadvertently put yourselves in danger . 
3863 => we have found you but you must not be followed any more . 
3864 => you have seen the follower ? 
3865 => asked the gold lord . 
3866 => were those two followers ? 
3867 => i asked . 
3868 => no , replied the emerald lord , they were not so dangerous , little more than local villains . 
3869 => the follower is not so forward in his ways . 
3870 => yes , i replied . 
3871 => we have seen the shadow of the follower . 
3872 => but not since we left the big city . 
3873 => that is good , said the emerald lord . 
3874 => i think that you left by an ancient way of which even he is unaware . 
3875 => you must trust in us for now , that is all we ask . 
3876 => how do we know that we can trust you ? 
3877 => asked crystal . 
3878 => the gold lord drew his horse back alongside hers and scrutinised her face . 
3879 => then he said : you do not have to know someone to trust them . 
3880 => i heard crystal draw breath . 
3881 => the gold lord continued : you can not know to trust us . 
3882 => trust is not gained in so short a while . 
3883 => we have travelled many miles to find your companion and bring him to safety . 
3884 => i admit we were not looking for two . 
3885 => to us , it is perhaps rather the case of whether we can trust you . 
3886 => we do not expect you to trust us , but by our actions and words we will endeavour to show we are honest , open and true . 
3887 => should you need to do so , you must judge us but that may not help you . 
3888 => you are travellers on a journey , foolish , young and brave , but we can offer safe passage in a dangerous land . 
3889 => we can not give you trust but i will say to you now , that if you wish to go on alone , then , much as it would grieve me , you may do so . 
3890 => understand that if you did do so , we are obliged by our oath to do all we can to protect you and we will still be there , in the distance , as we have been these past days , watching over you . 
3891 => the horseman looked on towards the summit that we were approaching and then spoke again . 
3892 => there is also another matter . 
3893 => there is one who wishes to speak with your companion . 
3894 => who ? 
3895 => i enquired simply . 
3896 => you may feel you know him already , but you do not . 
3897 => his name is dr 
3898 => wolfe . 
3899 => i shrugged . 
3900 => i dont know that name . 
3901 => i have heard him called by other names mythras . 
3902 => the magician ! 
3903 => i cried . 
3904 => no , not the same one you may have in mind . 
3905 => the name of mythras is just a title . 
3906 => but we will not speak of him more in this place ; it may not be safe to do so . 
3907 => our unwelcome companions know where we are so we can assume the follower also knows we are here . 
3908 => so saying , the gold lord rode ahead again and the party climbed the final slope , to a clearing on the top of the forest . 
3909 => there , an outcrop of rock had prevented the trees from taking purchase . 
3910 => that windy place commanded a view around the compass , from the sea in the distance behind us , to the mountains ahead . 
3911 => they were much closer now and towered on the horizon . 
3912 => the great slopes rose up , rank upon rank of wooded foothills , through bare escarpments and beyond , to the snow covered peaks that lay glistening in the sun . 
3913 => looking out , we traced the whole of our journey , from the distant grey smudge that was the big city , through the shimmering flat marshes , across the low level woods , past the town and into the forest below us . 
3914 => i gazed out to the distant light that was the sea but could not find my island home ; it was lost to view . 
3915 => i wondered when and how i would ever return there . 
3916 => we will stop here and breakfast , said the emerald lord and he unpacked a saddlebag containing food and drink . 
3917 => you have travelled well and much of the journey is complete . 
3918 => a cold wind was sweeping across the hills from the distant mountains and , after eating , we returned gratefully to the shelter of the trees . 
3919 => we travelled on seldom used paths but the horses picked their way carefully over the stones and undergrowth . 
3920 => the day passed quietly as we journeyed on , deep in thought . 
3921 => the gold lord rarely spoke and passed most of the time in silence . 
3922 => the emerald lord seemed freer of mind and talked for a while , pointing out some of the features of the place . 
3923 => after a lull , he began to chant a ballad of great length and beauty . 
3924 => it seemed very old and the tune was at once strange and yet familiar . 
3925 => the rhythm fitted the easy pace of the horses . 
3926 => i can only recall a few verses now . 
3927 => the tale was of a minstrel who sailed across the sea and met a princess but , although they fell in love , they had to part and go their separate ways . 
3928 => if not for the strangeness of the circumstance , the walk was beautiful . 
3929 => the forest was extensive and vista after vista opened before each ridge , as we climbed slowly towards the towering hills . 
3930 => the only people we met were the shepherds we passed as they lead their sheep and goats to the winter grazing . 
3931 => the two lords would always make way for the shepherds and they in their turn would bid us good day . 
3932 => it struck me that the two lords did not appear to be strangers to these people . 
3933 => the shepherds would give crystal and me a straight long stare as they passed , but made no comment . 
3934 => eventually , we came to a long wall that climbed over the hills and out of sight . 
3935 => it seemed incongruous after travelling so many miles without any sign of mans endeavours . 
3936 => the party followed the wall around to a track way and a gate . 
3937 => standing by the gate was an old man dressed in white . 
3938 => he came forward to speak to the gold lord . 
3939 => welcome , friend , he said in a firm voice as the great horseman dismounted . 
3940 => the two men shook hands and a flicker of a smile crossed their faces . 
3941 => this is dr 
3942 => wolfe , said the gold lord . 
3943 => then the old man turned to me and spoke again , welcome to erebos , we have waited long to meet you . 
3944 => he held out his hand and the firmness of his grip surprised me . 
3945 => good evening . 
3946 => i replied timidly . 
3947 => crystal looked down from her mount . 
3948 => i saw a look of suspicion in her face . 
3949 => the old man ignored her and turned towards the house . 
3950 => i saw a surprised look on the emerald lords face . 
3951 => i think if i had not been there that crystal might have ridden off at that moment . 
3952 => we walked through the gateway and into the courtyard of an old house . 
3953 => the gates closed behind us and were locked . 
3954 => we left the horses in the care of a groom . 
3955 => rooks crowed from the massive squat cedar trees that grew beside a sloping lawn . 
3956 => two cats , one black , one white , strolled beneath the tower walls . 
3957 => i looked up at the stony heights of the ancient house . 
3958 => the great building exuded strength and confidence in the certainty of its many years . 
3959 => we entered across a stone floor through wood panelled halls . 
3960 => you will be shown to your rooms and , when you are refreshed , i would wish to talk with you in the drawing room , dr 
3961 => wolfe spoke in an eloquent voice , indicating a large leather covered door beside him . 
3962 => a youth and a girl appeared and , with a courteous gesture , requested our packs . 
3963 => i refused politely and crystal followed my example . 
3964 => the two servants indicated a staircase and we followed them to an upper level where the girl ushered crystal one way and i went the other . 
3965 => we both wanted to remain together but there was a certain insistence in the gestures of our stewards . 
3966 => see you in a minute , i said to crystal as we went our separate ways but she remained unusually silent . 
3967 => my room was sumptuous and grand , but not at all comfortable . 
3968 => it consisted of a suite of rooms that could have contained a modest house within them . 
3969 => there was a bathroom , a living room and a bedroom , all of extravagant proportions . 
3970 => gold and crimson decoration and polished walnut cabinetry was everywhere in the furnishings . 
3971 => i had never seen so grand a place ; to me it was a palace and everything within it seemed to be as old as the building that contained it . 
3972 => despite what the gold lord had told us on the journey and the courtesy that he showed us , i felt somehow trapped . 
3973 => i had no idea where i was . 
3974 => strangers , without real names , surrounded me . 
3975 => i could not tell what the future held . 
3976 => however , i felt dirty from many days of travel and i needed to refresh myself . 
3977 => i had not washed properly since leaving home and the dust and tiredness of the long journey was uncomfortable . 
3978 => i put my luggage carefully into the furthest nook of one of the cabinets and went into the bathroom . 
3979 => i ran a full , hot bath and enjoyed a glorious and relaxing soak in the cleansing water . 
3980 => i had already found a change of clothes laid out for me and took advantage of the offering . 
3981 => the fit was not perfect , being for a stouter figure than my own , but the effect was generally pleasing . 
3982 => the clothes appeared old fashioned to my eyes but were neither formal nor casual . 
3983 => i transferred my few precious possessions into the pockets and ventured to the door . 
3984 => i walked stealthily along the corridor toward the place where i thought crystal was staying and quietly tried to open the doors . 
3985 => the third door was not locked and i entered a room like the one i had just left , but opposite both in form and furnishing . 
3986 => i called out quietly , crystal , but heard no reply . 
3987 => the room was very modern in style and all the furnishings were in black , white , grey and pink . 
3988 => i ventured to the bedroom door and stole quietly into the room . 
3989 => crystal was there , unkempt , scruffy , dirty and dressed just as she had been on entering the house . 
3990 => she hadnt even taken off her shoes . 
3991 => she was fast asleep on the bed , hugging her ragged backpack . 
3992 => she seemed vulnerable , young and still beautiful . 
3993 => gently , i laid my hand on her shoulder and tried to waken her . 
3994 => she opened her eyes and looked up at me . 
3995 => she seemed bemused , at first , but the familiar light soon returned to her face . 
3996 => she rose up on one elbow and smiled quizzically at me . 
3997 => you look just like one of them , she said and laughed . 
3998 => i had forgotten my clothes and felt ashamed , as though i had somehow let her down . 
3999 => she swung off the bed and stood up stretching . 
4000 => youre right , she yawned . 
4001 => lets see what theyve left me . 
4002 => a proper little lady ill look . 
4003 => i hate fancy dresses , and she picked up a pretty dress and held it up to herself . 
4004 => i think ill need a belt on that ! 
4005 => it was my turn to laugh . 
4006 => she stood with her ragged trousers hanging below the dress and smiled . 
4007 => she looked an angel and a tomboy all rolled into one . 
4008 => i left her to her ablutions and waited in the living room . 
4009 => i looked around and found books and maps on the shelves . 
4010 => excitedly , i opened the maps on the floor . 
4011 => i found erebos marked and felt relieved that at least this was a real place . 
4012 => there was no satisfaction in being lost , even in so grand a house as this . 
4013 => while crystal was engaged in the other room , i managed to trace our journey across four maps . 
4014 => the long passage from the island of suidhe , across to the big city already seemed like a distant dream . 
4015 => i followed on through the marshes and woodlands up to the foothills of the snowy mountains , where erebos lay and wondered how we would come out of this place . 
4016 => the delicate lady that emerged from the bedroom did not appear to me to be the same familiar person who i had seen a short while before . 
4017 => it was as though a butterfly had broken out from a chrysalis . 
4018 => i sat on the floor and stared , probably rudely , at the elegant creature that stood before me . 
4019 => i felt a sudden sense of pride in my companion and crystal did a small pirouette to show off for me . 
4020 => you might not like dresses but dresses like you , i said . 
4021 => you look gorgeous , and she laughed for the first time that day . 
4022 => typical bloke , she replied but i could see she was pleased at the compliment . 
4023 => nobody had interrupted us , but from below , in the hall , came the sound of a gong . 
4024 => i realised , after a moment of wondering , it was the call to dinner . 
4025 => i quickly folded the maps , which i took back to my room to put in my pack , and we descended the stairs together . 
4026 => the two lords awaited us and showed us into the dining hall where a great table lay spread with a feast . 
4027 => three of the chairs were already occupied . 
4028 => dr 
4029 => wolfe and two other lords stood as we entered and servants showed us to seats on either side of the old man . 
4030 => two waiters appeared and the meal commenced . 
4031 => dr 
4032 => wolfe and the lords were charming and made polite conversation while we ate . 
4033 => they asked me many questions concerning suidhe and listened with interest to all i told them about the place . 
4034 => however , i did not tell them of my adventures on sgurr-cavan , or the subsequent journeys that brought me to their table . 
4035 => crystal , in her turn , told them of her fathers farm in the heartland . 
4036 => she ended by telling them that she would return there soon to help her father in his hour of need . 
4037 => that is an honourable plan , i think , said dr 
4038 => wolfe . 
4039 => yes , you must go soon , of course . 
4040 => the other lords all agreed and pledged their assistance when the need arose , but crystal said simply , that is kind , but i do not need help , only freedom . 
4041 => a moment of silence passed . 
4042 => we had finished our meal , and the conversation closed . 
4043 => dr 
4044 => wolfe stood and spoke . 
4045 => now , my friends , we must all take our rest , for we are all tired . 
4046 => tomorrow , we have some business to pursue between us ; then our guests may return safely to their homes . 
4047 => we will weigh their burdens for them and our world will be safe . 
4048 => so saying , he turned and walked to the door followed by two of the lords . 
4049 => the three bowed their heads in unison and said goodnight , before leaving the chamber . 
4050 => the gold lord and the emerald lord accompanied us to the stairs and bade us sleep soundly and safely . 
4051 => crystal and i returned upstairs . 
4052 => at the top of the stairs crystal turned to me and whispered . 
4053 => should we stay in different rooms ? 
4054 => i dont feel safe in this place . 
4055 => well let everyone go to bed and then ill come and find you , i replied . 
4056 => its still early , we may as well get some rest for a few hours . 
4057 => we retired to our chambers . 
4058 => i felt tired and satiated . 
4059 => night clothes had been laid out on the bed . 
4060 => i lay on the bed , with a feeling of relief for the comfort it afforded , but with a deepening suspicion of dr 
4061 => wolfe . 
4062 => was he not trying too hard to be friendly ? 
4063 => what did he really want , and why ? 
4064 => had not mythras the magician of old been a bad man at heart and how was this new mythras different ? 
4065 => they seemed from the same mould to me . 
4066 => far into the night i awoke . 
4067 => the great house was cool in the darkness . 
4068 => the changing of the seasons had brewed more storms across the mountains . 
4069 => i got up , went to the window and looked out into the night . 
4070 => lightning flashed in the distance and the folds of the hills reverberated with the faint but distinct sound of thunder . 
4071 => rain worried the window glass , dulling the vision . 
4072 => a feeling of extreme emptiness filled my head as i looked out . 
4073 => the mountains were still a wild place , untamed by mankind . 
4074 => somehow , the feeling of wildness penetrated the thick walls of erebos and made me feel uneasy . 
4075 => the mountains had a life of their own and did not heed mortal men . 
4076 => erebos was not a welcome intruder . 
4077 => it was late and the house was silent . 
4078 => i decided to see if crystal was also awake and went to the door . 
4079 => i turned the handle but it would not open ; the door was locked . 
4080 => i felt angry and worried , but there was nothing i could do to open it , so i returned to the window . 
4081 => i heard another sound coming from outside in the night and it made my heart stop . 
4082 => it was the call of an animal not unlike a wolf , the same sound we had heard from the creatures who burnt our tent in the yew wood . 
4083 => were they roaming through the night outside erebos ? 
4084 => the awful howling cry came again and filled the night air from somewhere in the woods . 
4085 => the sound seemed quite close but then there was silence . 
4086 => i stood in the dark waiting for something more , but all remained quiet . 
4087 => i shivered as i remembered the fire in the coomb . 
4088 => the memory almost made me pleased that the door was locked . 
4089 => there was nothing i could do to get to crystal that night . 
4090 => but i had no reason to suspect she was in any more danger than i was in this house . 
4091 => i returned to bed , where i slept fitfully until the morning light awoke me . 
4092 => chapter eight the snowy mountains immediately i awoke , i went to the door . 
4093 => it was unlocked . 
4094 => i went along to crystals room and knocked gently before trying her door . 
4095 => it opened without difficulty . 
4096 => crystal was standing looking apprehensive . 
4097 => a look of relief spread across her face as i came in . 
4098 => im sorry , i said . 
4099 => my door was locked . 
4100 => i couldnt come around . 
4101 => no worry . 
4102 => we wont make that mistake a second time , she answered . 
4103 => just then the gong sounded summoning us to an early breakfast . 
4104 => we must see what they want today but we will find a moment to plan something , i said and she nodded as we went to the stairs . 
4105 => the pattern established the previous evening continued on friday morning . 
4106 => our hosts were formal and polite . 
4107 => the party enjoyed a good breakfast followed by a tour of erebos and the grounds . 
4108 => out on the lawns we were escorted by the emerald lord . 
4109 => last night i heard wolves , or something very like wolves , said crystal . 
4110 => there are indeed wolves in the hills , but they are not dangerous , unless you are a sheep ! 
4111 => he replied . 
4112 => but they sounded like the men you rescued us from , she persisted . 
4113 => ah . 
4114 => i see your point . 
4115 => i do not think you need fear those here . 
4116 => no , the sounds you heard are more likely real wolves . 
4117 => i would rather meet a real wolf myself . 
4118 => you really need not concern yourself unless , of course , you were planning to walk out in the night ? 
4119 => crystal caught my eye but made no reply . 
4120 => all morning we were chaperoned . 
4121 => it was clear these people did not intend to leave us alone together for a minute . 
4122 => but just before lunch crystal excused herself . 
4123 => when we sat down she dropped a note into my lap unnoticed . 
4124 => i put it in my pocket for later . 
4125 => dr 
4126 => wolfe called me aside after lunch and showed me into his study , shutting the door behind us . 
4127 => he bade me sit on a chair beside his desk while he paced around the room . 
4128 => i began to feel nervous on my own . 
4129 => harry , i am very glad that i have found you . 
4130 => i know we will get along well . 
4131 => dont you agree ? 
4132 => he asked . 
4133 => yes , i suppose ... 
4134 => i hesitated . 
4135 => dr 
4136 => wolfe ignored me and continued but his voice took on a strange air of obsession as he spoke , as a man possessed . 
4137 => i felt scared by him but determined not to show it any further . 
4138 => you know what you have that interests me . 
4139 => but i do not think that you know what it can do , what it means . 
4140 => we have to protect our world , harry . 
4141 => that is the aim of the council of the elders and so they have placed on me the task of caring for the stone that you possess and making it safe . 
4142 => you see , harry , as long as you have this thing you will be followed by many strangers until one of them obtains this precious stone . 
4143 => year after year they will follow you until one dark night , all alone .. 
4144 => well you have seen it already , and his words made me immediately suspicious . 
4145 => had he hired the wolf men ? 
4146 => he continued . 
4147 => i think you will see that it is the good thing to do , to let me have the white crystal . 
4148 => i can take the burden from your shoulders and then you will be able to live in peace again . 
4149 => is that not so , harry ? 
4150 => yes , well , maybe , i answered unwillingly . 
4151 => now , may i see this famous gemstone please ? 
4152 => i will show you the white crystal , i said hoarsely and then stopped . 
4153 => i gathered all my nerve to continue , i knew this was a critical moment and my voice came out stronger and clearer than i could have imagined as i gripped the pouch in my pocket , i will show you the crystal because you could always take it from me if you wished , that is clear . 
4154 => but , before i do , can you show me that you are indeed what you say you are and can you also show me where you will keep the crystal , so i know it will be safe ? 
4155 => then perhaps we can discuss the value of this precious stone to you and to me . 
4156 => dr 
4157 => wolfe seemed surprised and annoyed that i had answered him back . 
4158 => he spoke curtly . 
4159 => this is a safe place , harry , as you have seen . 
4160 => it is much stronger than you realise . 
4161 => but , you are the keeper . 
4162 => it is your destiny to know the secret of erebos and you will also see the place where the stone will be kept . 
4163 => you will understand that it is a safe haven . 
4164 => as to my honesty , i can not prove that so well , but i ask you to consider your own words . 
4165 => indeed , i could easily take the stone if i so wished but i have not done so . 
4166 => far from it , i have arranged your rescue from certain disaster and safe passage through dangerous lands . 
4167 => i have already shown that i have your interest at heart . 
4168 => does this not show me in my true light ? 
4169 => this is a lonely place and you are far from home , but you can trust me . 
4170 => as for your recompense , i would not stoop so low as to discuss it . 
4171 => but rest assured you will not be wanting in that regard . 
4172 => now let us go . 
4173 => i will show you the secret of erebos that no other mortal man has witnessed in this generation . 
4174 => dr 
4175 => wolfe turned and beckoned me to follow . 
4176 => i thought of running out , but i was curious to see the secret , so i followed him . 
4177 => as i walked past the desk , i looked down and saw an old coin resting on a tray . 
4178 => dr 
4179 => wolfe was already by the bookcase ; i reached out and quickly took the coin . 
4180 => i slid it into my pocket and continued to follow the old man . 
4181 => he opened a hidden door in the bookcase and we entered a passage that led to a stairway . 
4182 => moments later , i was walking swiftly along the spiral tunnel that went down to the old mines beneath erebos . 
4183 => the air was stifling . 
4184 => the atmosphere was full of tension . 
4185 => through the second door , sulphur fumes stung my eyes and dried my throat until it felt raw . 
4186 => the sound of what lay ahead obliterated thought and throbbed in my head , on the edge of pain . 
4187 => but i could not turn back . 
4188 => the effect was magnetic and drew me on as surely as any nightmare . 
4189 => minutes later , we entered the great chamber and the intense heat from the molten rock that glowed within engulfed us . 
4190 => the ruddy light reflected on the face of the old man and glinted from his skin and hair . 
4191 => he appeared daemonic , standing in that awful cavern . 
4192 => the air was full of sound : steam hissed and spat as , far below , the grumbling , slow voice of molten rock aboil , growled through the lurid light . 
4193 => we approached a deep glowering well that lay between the flares and vapours . 
4194 => even dr 
4195 => wolfe was belittled by the slow violence of the power that had been tapped . 
4196 => new beds of glowing embers covered the floors and walls of the cavern and danger filled the air . 
4197 => i walked unwillingly towards the railings where the old man stood gazing . 
4198 => the heat was intense and the acrid air burnt my lungs . 
4199 => he turned to me and his ancient eyes were blazing coals reflecting the boiling red rock . 
4200 => he radiated a new excitement . 
4201 => i could see his pulse beating fast beneath his temples as the sweat glistened across his forehead . 
4202 => he was on the verge of control . 
4203 => this great place , he shouted majestically , lifting his arms , is the source of my power ! 
4204 => he waved about the chamber as he spoke . 
4205 => it was at that moment that i decided he was probably mad , like his predecessor before him . 
4206 => he put his hand out and drew me towards him . 
4207 => i shivered involuntarily . 
4208 => the heat was insufferable , yet his tight fingers felt as cold and hard as ice on my shoulders . 
4209 => then he spoke firmly but distinctly above the pulsating roar of the cavern . 
4210 => and this is the place where my white crystal will live . 
4211 => see , all is prepared , and his long bony finger pointed to a rock pillar that rose from the centre of the molten rock pool . 
4212 => it appeared to be a crystal pillar , about six feet high . 
4213 => i immediately thought of the story of mythras and the great storm on suidhe when the strange pillar had appeared and disappeared . 
4214 => could this be the same pillar ? 
4215 => no mortal man will ever take it from that place . 
4216 => where is it , boy ? 
4217 => come let us do this great thing together , now ! 
4218 => i dont have it here , i cried , alarmed and tried to loosen his grip . 
4219 => i could see no way to reach the pillar and survive . 
4220 => he seemed angry for an instant but then he calmed and said , spitting out the words : of course not , of course not . 
4221 => then let us go and i will come and take the burden tonight , after the others have retired . 
4222 => we need not worry them with our troubles , few must ever know of this secret . 
4223 => tonight , at midnight , you and i will return here , for the last time , together . 
4224 => the old man turned and walked quickly towards the entrance to the chamber . 
4225 => he paid me no heed but i was not going to stay there a moment longer . 
4226 => i followed him as he strode back up the passageways and to the house . 
4227 => i felt flushed and dirty after our visit to the underworld . 
4228 => in the study , dr 
4229 => wolfe was going to speak to me again , but there was a knock at the door and the gold lord entered . 
4230 => he seemed disturbed when he saw me and i began to realise that something was wrong between them . 
4231 => i quickly excused myself and returned to the drawing room where crystal was waiting . 
4232 => i must have looked strange , for she ran to me . 
4233 => harry , whatevers happened ? 
4234 => she cried and tugged me through the door , shutting it behind us . 
4235 => i was shaking and sweat soaked my clothes . 
4236 => in the mirror over the fireplace , i could see my reddened eyes staring out . 
4237 => my voice was hoarse and i could hardly speak . 
4238 => crystal found me some water ; i sat down and briefly told her about the secret of erebos and how dr 
4239 => wolfe had been so strange and evil in the awful cavern . 
4240 => we must escape from here , i said . 
4241 => hes coming for me tonight at midnight , to get the stone . 
4242 => i dont think he knows about yours . 
4243 => i want you to look after my crystal until we get out of here . 
4244 => it will be dangerous if they find out . 
4245 => will you do it ? 
4246 => of course , ill put them together in the box . 
4247 => they belong together , she replied . 
4248 => i took the crystal out and the coin fell out of my pocket . 
4249 => i picked it up and looked at the date : 1853 . 
4250 => put this with them , i said . 
4251 => maybe it will bring us luck , and i gave the stone and the coin to crystal . 
4252 => the evening was approaching and we returned to our rooms . 
4253 => there was no sign of the others , but we heard raised voices in the study as we passed . 
4254 => the gold lord and dr 
4255 => wolfe were clearly having a disagreement . 
4256 => if they are arguing we can probably have some time to ourselves , i whispered . 
4257 => lets go upstairs and make that plan . 
4258 => in my rooms i shut the door behind us . 
4259 => remembering the note that crystal had secretly given me , i pulled it out and was surprised to read : do not go into his study and i looked at her but she remained grim and silent . 
4260 => what do you know , crystal ? 
4261 => i went in there when you were all together . 
4262 => it was just a feeling . 
4263 => i cant explain but it was like , evil in there . 
4264 => i caught her eye for a long moment , but there was nothing more to be said about it now . 
4265 => lets look at these , i said , going to my bag to get the maps . 
4266 => someones been through this . 
4267 => i suppose i should have expected that . 
4268 => well , they might have been surprised to see all that money ! 
4269 => i dont think anythings been taken , but then we know what they were looking for . 
4270 => the maps were still there and we laid them out on the floor . 
4271 => i think we should go up here into the mountains , suggested crystal , thats the last place theyll expect to find us . 
4272 => look theres a path marked from the corner of the woods behind the house , i pointed it out , well try that . 
4273 => gives us plenty of cover until we are well away . 
4274 => that way we can join up with this trail , crystals voice sounded bright again as her finger followed it across the sheet . 
4275 => it leads across the mountain ranges down towards the plains and the farms in the heartland . 
4276 => thats the best way to go . 
4277 => its a long way . 
4278 => well need some food . 
4279 => ill guess we can find water . 
4280 => but im with you , i agreed , but i was far from sure . 
4281 => we both knew it would be a long and dangerous journey but it offered a chance of escape . 
4282 => i sat back thinking it through . 
4283 => what are you thinking about ? 
4284 => asked crystal , looking at me . 
4285 => dont tell me . 
4286 => i know , she continued . 
4287 => wolves . 
4288 => ive been thinking about those too . 
4289 => i dont know why , but i think that the emerald lord was telling the truth . 
4290 => not that i want to meet a wolf in the night ! 
4291 => anyway , we have no choice , weve got to get out of here . 
4292 => well pack our things and be ready to leave in a hurry , i said . 
4293 => we must put some provisions in our packs . 
4294 => you see what you can find in the kitchens and i will search for rope and more matches , before they come looking for us again . 
4295 => together we went out and found the back stairs to the kitchens . 
4296 => we heard mens voices inside . 
4297 => there were pantries in the passage but we had to pass the open door to reach them . 
4298 => wait here . 
4299 => ill get their attention and keep them busy , crystal whispered , you get the stuff . 
4300 => heres the bag . 
4301 => she loosened her blouse , pushed back her hair and undid some of the buttons down the front of the long plaid skirt she was wearing and winked at me . 
4302 => i waited as crystal minced casually into the room . 
4303 => there were three men sat round a table playing cards . 
4304 => they all looked up as she entered and crystal smiled warmly at them . 
4305 => she took a stool and placing it well away from the open door , shook back her hair and carefully arranged herself on the stool so they would get a favourable view . 
4306 => those short swarthy men were completely snared by this tall , pale and beautiful young creature . 
4307 => she started talking and laughing even though she had no idea if they could understand her . 
4308 => she was sure they would understand the universal language she was presenting with her body . 
4309 => i just had to come and thank you for all the glorious food she began . 
4310 => i darted silently past the door and crept into the pantries . 
4311 => i took cheese , dried meat , biscuits and tins of sardines . 
4312 => i also found a couple of knives and a spoon . 
4313 => two minutes later i was out again and could hear crystals bright voice talking absolute nonsense in the kitchen . 
4314 => i slid past the door just in time to see one of the men getting up to move towards crystal . 
4315 => i kept on going back up to her room and waited . 
4316 => two minutes later , looking flushed and a little excited , crystal burst in . 
4317 => that was close . 
4318 => i dont think they understand a word i was saying , she exclaimed . 
4319 => they dont have a sense of humour either , i would guess . 
4320 => but they do like beautiful girls ! 
4321 => i added and crystal looked demure as she buttoned up her clothes again . 
4322 => yes , but you should have seen the look on the maids face when she walked in . 
4323 => if looks could kill , id be dead . 
4324 => she sussed me straight off . 
4325 => shell be on her guard now . 
4326 => probably a good thing were going ! 
4327 => we hid both our packs in crystals room and donned coats to go in search of rope . 
4328 => daring the back stairs one more time , we slid out of the servants door and headed round to the stable yard . 
4329 => horses , whispered crystal , why dont we ? 
4330 => no , i couldnt . 
4331 => anyway , it will be dark out there . 
4332 => she looked disappointed but nodded . 
4333 => in one of the tack rooms we found ropes , candles and matches . 
4334 => we were on our way back when we heard a voice calling . 
4335 => weve been missed , i whispered . 
4336 => you go back round to the front door and ill take this up the back way and come down the front . 
4337 => i rushed up stairs and stashed the bag under the bed . 
4338 => then i took a piece of twig and jammed it into crystals door lock to block it . 
4339 => two minutes later i was walking down the stairs just in time to hear crystal praising the horses . 
4340 => we both went back up and quickly finished our packing . 
4341 => we split the food , had a rope apiece and hid the packs deep in a cupboard . 
4342 => finally , i took back my crystal from her box . 
4343 => harry , crystal stopped . 
4344 => yes , something in her voice caught my attention . 
4345 => harry , if we dont make it tonight i just wanted you to know something . 
4346 => of course well make it , i interrupted and then wished i wasnt so clumsy . 
4347 => its just that i wanted you to have something to remember me by . 
4348 => here .. 
4349 => she held out her hand to give me a small brooch shaped like a fish . 
4350 => you mustnt give me this . 
4351 => it must be precious . 
4352 => no , i want you to have it . 
4353 => then , if we get parted , you can keep it to remember me by , and she gently took my hand , laid the brooch in the palm and then closed my fingers over it . 
4354 => keep it . 
4355 => dont ever forget . 
4356 => i wont forget ; how could i forget you ? 
4357 => i promise . 
4358 => still holding my hand , she kissed me gently on the cheek , like a sister might kiss a brother . 
4359 => i felt the air quiver between us . 
4360 => just then the dinner gong sounded for six oclock and we descended to our last supper at erebos . 
4361 => the table was as before and , much to my surprise , there was no sign of the afternoons events in dr 
4362 => wolfes behaviour . 
4363 => he was kind , considerate and even jovial , as though nothing had happened between us . 
4364 => if the argument with the gold lord had meant anything , it was gone now , or so it seemed at first . 
4365 => crystal looked bright and radiant and quite put off her previous quiet . 
4366 => the emerald lord smiled at us both and seemed pleased with this improvement . 
4367 => the gold lord was polite but more than once i caught him looking earnestly at me and dr 
4368 => wolfe . 
4369 => dr 
4370 => wolfe spoke at the end of the meal and the result of the argument with the gold lord became clear . 
4371 => only i knew that dr 
4372 => wolfe had other plans . 
4373 => i trust you will remain as our guests for another day ? 
4374 => then , perhaps , you will continue your journey with my companions , the gold lord and the emerald lord . 
4375 => they would consider it an honour to be of assistance . 
4376 => they know the country well and will show you the safest routes to your destinations . 
4377 => yes , we will travel on before long , crystal replied . 
4378 => i looked across at her and our eyes met . 
4379 => even then i felt tension mounting in me , but was determined not to let it show . 
4380 => we went up to our rooms as early as we could , accompanied by the silent servants , who always seemed to look at us suspiciously . 
4381 => tonight , the maid stared at crystal with dagger eyes . 
4382 => we both knew she was suspicious but there was no helping that now . 
4383 => this time i set a chair next to my door and sat on it to wait . 
4384 => i waited for a long time , listening at my door , before i went to venture out and go to crystals room but , to my horror , i could not open it . 
4385 => they had silently locked the door , but how i couldnt tell . 
4386 => i had heard nothing , not so much as a click . 
4387 => i was trapped . 
4388 => why hadnt i blocked that lock too ? 
4389 => nunce ! 
4390 => i exclaimed . 
4391 => i knew that i had to get out before the old man came for me and took me down to the fearful furnaces below . 
4392 => i looked out of all the windows but they all opened onto vertical walls and i could not escape from any of them . 
4393 => none of the cupboards contained a way out , nor were there any hatches in the ceiling . 
4394 => i sat on the edge of the settee , in the sitting room , with my head in my hands . 
4395 => i could not see any way out . 
4396 => the clock on the mantelpiece chimed eleven and i looked up . 
4397 => i only had one hour in which to escape . 
4398 => suddenly , a thought struck me : maybe the answer was right in front of my eyes . 
4399 => i crossed the room to the large ornate fireplace and peered behind the screen . 
4400 => it was indeed a large flue , although how i could climb it or whether i would be able to escape from the top , i could not determine . 
4401 => i took a pillowcase and made it into a balaclava hat to protect my face and eyes . 
4402 => i found , in a drawer , a pair of leather gloves that would protect my hands . 
4403 => still wearing my fine clothes i crawled into the claustrophobic fireplace and tried the climb . 
4404 => my first attempt failed because i could not grip the sides of the flue with my feet . 
4405 => i removed my shoes and socks and slung them by their laces from my belt and tried again . 
4406 => i was able to grip between the courses of bricks with my fingers and toes , and by wedging my back against the side of the flue i could slowly scrape my way skyward . 
4407 => the chimney was filthy and the pungent smell of soot and damp filled my nostrils , but the makeshift hat was effective in keeping the worst of it off my face . 
4408 => the flue became narrower towards the top but i managed to push my way up . 
4409 => i knew one false move and i would crash to the bottom and all would be lost . 
4410 => my limbs ached and trembled from the exertion of the climb and i struggled to find a toehold to support myself at the top . 
4411 => the chimney had no pot but a gaping square brick stack with slanted holes made in the side for draught . 
4412 => i dislodged some loose bricks from one side and pushed a hole through . 
4413 => all the time the strain on my limbs to support my weight by pressing back against the stack was becoming more painful and desperate . 
4414 => the bricks fell with a rumbling crash and i froze at the loud report , but no other sounds followed , and i continued to enlarge the hole until i could reach through and carefully let the bricks down . 
4415 => eventually , it was big enough to crawl through . 
4416 => i looked over the edge in the semi-dark and saw a large , flat , lead-covered roof with perhaps twenty similar stacks emerging from it . 
4417 => i sighed in relief at my good fortune in finding a flat roof . 
4418 => it took the last of my strength to crawl through the hole and tumble down the outside . 
4419 => i lay still for a minute , unable to move my aching legs enough to raise myself . 
4420 => in the distance i heard a clock strike the half hour and i forced myself to get up to look about . 
4421 => there was a higher roof above on both sides and a stairwell that led to a small doorway . 
4422 => the door had no keyhole but was bolted and i concluded that it could only be opened from within . 
4423 => returning to the roof , i counted the chimneys across from where i had emerged and then called softly down the third one . 
4424 => i prayed that this would be crystals chimney . 
4425 => chrissy , i hissed , chrissy , go to the fireplace . 
4426 => but there was no reply . 
4427 => i called again . 
4428 => my voice sounded too loud in the night . 
4429 => there was still no reply , so i dropped a piece of stone down the chimney . 
4430 => it fell with a clatter into the fireplace below . 
4431 => i called for a third time . 
4432 => chrissy . 
4433 => oh , please hear me . 
4434 => chrissy ... 
4435 => i listened . 
4436 => there was only silence at first , but then i heard a scraping sound below . 
4437 => the fire screen moved and the sound of crystals surprised voice called up to me . 
4438 => where are you ? 
4439 => find the doorway to the roof , it must be at the top of the next flight of stairs , and unbolt it , ill be waiting . 
4440 => im on my way , she replied . 
4441 => moments later , we stood face to face at the top of the stairs , in the dark . 
4442 => i noticed that she had changed back into her old clothes . 
4443 => it was reassuring to have the real crystal back again . 
4444 => we tiptoed back to her room to make our escape . 
4445 => i wedged the door shut and stood for a moment in silence , listening for any following footsteps , but heard none . 
4446 => crystal silently laughed when she saw me in the light . 
4447 => soot and dirt covered my clothes and i still had the pillowcase over my head . 
4448 => i brushed myself down and washed my hands quickly before grabbing our packs and joining crystal in the sitting room . 
4449 => the clock was showing a quarter to midnight and in fifteen minutes or less dr 
4450 => wolfe would discover that i was missing . 
4451 => unlike mine , her bedroom had a small stone balcony and i tied the rope , which i had knotted earlier , to the balustrade . 
4452 => crystal went down first , disappearing into the darkness below . 
4453 => i could not see her but the rope went slack and then jerked twice . 
4454 => i pulled up the rope and tied on the backpacks . 
4455 => these i lowered , one at a time . 
4456 => it seemed to take forever to tie and untie the knots . 
4457 => i kept looking behind me at the door . 
4458 => suppose dr 
4459 => wolfe was early ? 
4460 => at last i was ready to climb down myself . 
4461 => my hands and feet were already sore and blistered from climbing the chimney , so the rope , which was a little thin , cut painfully into my skin . 
4462 => i dropped down the last four feet to land beside my friend . 
4463 => we were on our way to freedom and it was just five to midnight . 
4464 => i sat down and slipped on my socks and shoes and gathered up our packs . 
4465 => my raw hands and swollen feet slowed my progress . 
4466 => finally , we were ready . 
4467 => somewhere , inside the great house , a clock began to strike midnight . 
4468 => what happened next terrified us both with its shock and surprise . 
4469 => there was an ear splitting crack . 
4470 => we both dropped to the ground . 
4471 => there followed a deep and thunderous rumble from somewhere far below us . 
4472 => i felt the ground move beneath me and i jumped up and pulled crystal away from the house . 
4473 => the earth was shivering violently and , from above , the balustrade crashed to the ground crushing the rope beneath it , just at the spot where we had been crouching . 
4474 => a frightening silence filled the air . 
4475 => the tremor had passed . 
4476 => the earth held its breath . 
4477 => we stood momentarily stunned and fixed to the spot . 
4478 => then crystal grabbed my hand and dragged me away from the place . 
4479 => this way , lets go , she called hoarsely . 
4480 => we turned and ran as fast as we could , across the lawns , to the wall . 
4481 => my heart pounded in panic . 
4482 => behind us , in the house , came the sound of shouting and commotion . 
4483 => we scrambled over the wall and ran into the woods behind the house , towards the path that led up into the mountains . 
4484 => somewhere ahead , i heard a wolf cry out in the night . 
4485 => ***** while harry was descending the rope from the balustrade to the ground , dr 
4486 => wolfe was deep beneath the house , in the old mines , checking his preparations . 
4487 => the old man had planned to leave the house that night and knew that he would probably not return . 
4488 => he threw the last boxes of papers and books into the smouldering cauldron of molten rock . 
4489 => the fires of erebos consumed many volumes and studies that night . 
4490 => dr 
4491 => wolfe no longer needed them . 
4492 => the white crystal was almost in his possession and with it he would receive the knowledge he had been seeking all his life . 
4493 => he thought he would be able to move into a different time , to infiltrate any place in history unseen , unknown : welcome or unwelcome . 
4494 => he planned to influence the world as a shaman , to become a mystery force no one could stop . 
4495 => but if dr 
4496 => wolfe had understood the magic of the stone , he would not have been so eager to possess it . 
4497 => dr 
4498 => wolfe knew that harry had the white crystal and he had guessed that he kept it with him . 
4499 => at first he thought he would take it by force . 
4500 => but the gold lord was suspicious . 
4501 => he had to be careful . 
4502 => there must be no trace . 
4503 => he had a bottle of camphor ready to silence the boy in his room . 
4504 => the old magician would take the stone and bring the boy down to the molten pit . 
4505 => he knew he needed the spell , the magic words that had been lost . 
4506 => it was this , not just the crystal that the boy possessed . 
4507 => it would not take long to get the spoken spell from harry here , tonight . 
4508 => no-one could defy the terror of being hung from the pulpit over that appalling molten lake for long . 
4509 => once he had what he wanted he could just let the boy drop into the lava and be consumed ; there would be no trace of him left . 
4510 => dr 
4511 => wolfe could then use the crystal to leave erebos . 
4512 => by dawn he would already be many miles away unseen and maybe years away , too . 
4513 => he intended to go to the council of the elders and secretly to discover the source of their power . 
4514 => he could infiltrate the chambers of power , wherever they were to be found . 
4515 => dr 
4516 => wolfe would become sicarius mythras at last . 
4517 => he trembled with excitement as he thought of the future . 
4518 => he was old but now , he could live forever . 
4519 => with his task completed , dr 
4520 => wolfe ascended to the house , and went up to harrys room . 
4521 => he had the key in his hand ready to unlock the door . 
4522 => it was turning twelve oclock ; he stood outside the room and , just for a moment , he hesitated . 
4523 => as the great tower clock struck the first chime of midnight , a cracking sound as loud as a thunderbolt filled the air . 
4524 => it came from beneath the house . 
4525 => this was not part of his plan . 
4526 => his heart stopped for a second , then he turned and ran down the stairs towards the mines . 
4527 => he had left the doors open to take the boy through . 
4528 => they must be closed . 
4529 => the ground beneath him began to shiver as he ran into the tunnel . 
4530 => the door behind him crashed shut . 
4531 => a roaring like thunder echoed along the corridors ; the sound hurt his ears . 
4532 => the walls moved and rocks cracked in jagged lines above his head . 
4533 => he turned and ran back to the door but he could not move it . 
4534 => there was no escape . 
4535 => a glowing mass of choking sulphurous smoke billowed along the tunnel towards him and dr 
4536 => wolfe cowered in the corner . 
4537 => he held his breath and closed his eyes for as long as he could . 
4538 => when he opened his eyes again , the smoke had risen and the vibration had stopped . 
4539 => erebos was silent and he breathed in relief . 
4540 => still shaking , he tried the door again but it held fast . 
4541 => harry and crystal were at that moment escaping to the mountains and dr 
4542 => wolfe was a prisoner in the mines of erebos . 
4543 => the same workings , abandoned many centuries before because of the lava flow that had broken into the tunnels , were slowly claiming another victim . 
4544 => the pressure was building below , in the silent mines , once more . 
4545 => already , the magma pool nearly filled the huge chamber . 
4546 => the glowing molten rock crept along slowly climbing up the spiral passage , pushed inexorably forward by an unstoppable pressure from beneath the earths crust . 
4547 => the walls of the tunnel around him began to glow a dull red in the fearful heat . 
4548 => dr 
4549 => wolfe stood and waited in the awful ruddy light . 
4550 => the rocks all around were grinding and rasping as the pressure built . 
4551 => rock cracked and crumbled from the walls and ceiling . 
4552 => dr 
4553 => wolfe faced his final avenger and the madness filled his mind as he screamed in terror . 
4554 => he turned to scratch at the heavy steel door but it was sealed and broken . 
4555 => suddenly , the lights went out and he split the glowing dark in a huge roar of anger . 
4556 => tra-a-a-i-i-i-t-t-o-r-s-s ! 
4557 => then he turned to face the oncoming doom and dropped to his knees . 
4558 => he spoke in a quiet voice , his last words in this world , but there was no one to hear him . 
4559 => forgive me , harry , i am mad . 
4560 => to me now , my own destruction . 
4561 => looking up , his proud face looked world weary , the aged face of a man resigned to death . 
4562 => a gentle face , a sad face , perhaps he had found some truth at last . 
4563 => meanwhile , after the tremor , the lords of the double cross had assembled in the drawing room . 
4564 => they searched the house and found that dr 
4565 => wolfe , harry and crystal had disappeared . 
4566 => the gold lord looked shaken as he spoke . 
4567 => i do believe that dr 
4568 => wolfe has turned to evil . 
4569 => i should have seen it earlier . 
4570 => we may already have failed . 
4571 => everyone , search the property for our guests . 
4572 => i fear for their lives . 
4573 => if we find dr 
4574 => wolfe , do not spare him , he is mad , and his voice rasped as he spoke . 
4575 => has he the young ones ? 
4576 => asked the emerald lord . 
4577 => i fear they have been taken . 
4578 => they may be dead already , maybe worse , and he grimaced . 
4579 => they began their search and their suspicions were heightened when they found that dr 
4580 => wolfe had removed many of his most precious books and belongings . 
4581 => none of them suspected the truth and none knew of the disused mines below the house . 
4582 => the gold lord despatched two messengers to warn the council of the elders . 
4583 => the remainder of the party found no clues when they searched the house and grounds . 
4584 => there were two further tremors during the night and neither animals nor servants would stay near the place any longer . 
4585 => they decided to shut the house and go down into the heartland to safer ground . 
4586 => before the morning had come , the lords of the double-cross had left , never to return , and erebos lay deserted in the desolate corrie below the mountains . 
4587 => ***** crystal and i climbed steadily through the night , high in the hills above the old house , to find the old paths we had seen marked on the maps . 
4588 => the night was strangely quiet . 
4589 => the animals had all been terrified by the earthquake and had fled . 
4590 => the tremor had also scared us but there was little else we could do except continue to walk . 
4591 => the moon shone down and lit the scene with a cold pale light that revealed every tree and rock as sharp and sinister silhouettes . 
4592 => we were two wary travellers and kept under cover as much as we were able . 
4593 => every sound seemed loud in the silence of the night , and a second distant wolf-like cry made us freeze in our tracks . 
4594 => the sound subsided into echoes in the valleys below erebos and we continued in haste . 
4595 => after many hours of walking , we found a shepherds hut on the hillside . 
4596 => we pushed open the door and entered the place to rest . 
4597 => we were exhausted . 
4598 => we slept with our feet against the door and our heads on our packs . 
4599 => dawn broke over the mountains and awoke crystal and me in the old tumbledown shelter . 
4600 => we ate sparingly , not knowing how long our supplies might need to last . 
4601 => i cautiously opened the door and we both went out into the cool morning light . 
4602 => the mountains towered above us majestically . 
4603 => i could detect the black form of a large bird circling in an early thermal , high up in the soft blue sky . 
4604 => below it there were perhaps half a dozen smaller birds - gulls - chasing , dipping , diving and calling in fear and agitation of the great bird . 
4605 => the eagle floated serene and unfettered by the protestations beneath him . 
4606 => watching the eagles slow deliberate movements through the early air filled me with hope . 
4607 => he dropped suddenly to a distant , remote cliff face , close to the mountain top . 
4608 => behind me crystal stopped still behind me and placed her hand on my shoulder . 
4609 => thank you , she said quietly and i knew our troubles were shared . 
4610 => for a while we stood in the silence alone in our thoughts , but together . 
4611 => in the valley , far below us , we could make out the distant form of erebos , its empty windows glinting in the sun . 
4612 => we turned our back on the evil place and began to walk up an old sheep track . 
4613 => the path crossed a bridge over a stream and continued on up to the head of the valley , where crystal hoped to find the road that would eventually take us down towards her fathers farm . 
4614 => we walked along the path beside the stream . 
4615 => the water was little more than a trickle but the stream bed was a deep , wide channel , fit for a mountain river , where the water had eroded the rock over the centuries . 
4616 => crystal looked at the small stream in despair but appeared more determined with each step forward and upward . 
4617 => her hands clenched into fists and her stride became sure and firm . 
4618 => i noticed that she seemed to be looking for something up ahead . 
4619 => what is it , crystal ? 
4620 => i asked . 
4621 => youll see . 
4622 => youll see it soon enough , she replied , her fists clenched even tighter . 
4623 => we climbed through the wooded valley beside the stream bed . 
4624 => dense foliage enclosed the slopes but at the valley head we could see open sky . 
4625 => we clambered up the final steep slope onto an exposed rocky ridge . 
4626 => the air was cold and clear . 
4627 => we had ascended hundreds of feet into the mountains . 
4628 => crystal climbed the last few feet to the ridge , stopped short and looked straight ahead . 
4629 => i heard her draw breath with a hiss like an angry snake . 
4630 => suddenly , i saw it too . 
4631 => the object of crystals hate , the dam , loomed above us . 
4632 => it stood like a fortress wall across the valley . 
4633 => emerging from the base was a massive silver pipeline that snaked down the valley and into the distance . 
4634 => it was the pipeline that had drained the life from her fathers farm , and from many others . 
4635 => the water company had never planned a compensation reservoir for the few people who lived in the heartland . 
4636 => so , thats it , i whispered as i looked in awe at the smooth wall ahead . 
4637 => i did not know what she intended to do when we reached the dam . 
4638 => but crystal just wanted to see the monstrous construction and to understand her enemy . 
4639 => she imagined herself somehow stopping the water from the pipeline by some act of sabotage but she knew , deep within , that it was hopeless and foolish to try anything . 
4640 => she also knew that she would need more than bare hands to destroy that mighty barrier . 
4641 => we clambered up a steep slope onto a broad new road that switch backed its way up to the dam . 
4642 => the road seemed incongruous in such a remote area . 
4643 => we stepped boldly along the deserted carriageway and we reached the dam after a mile long walk . 
4644 => the construction was massive . 
4645 => the main wall of the dam was buttressed with sloping pillars and a wide coping that overhung the valley . 
4646 => the road ran across the top of the wall , broad and black . 
4647 => there was a high parapet wall and railings on either side . 
4648 => we looked across from the roadway and saw that the arid mountainside dropped in to a great lake that curved away into the distance between the peaks that rose up on either side . 
4649 => a tower of stone emerged like a strange concrete island in the centre of the lake . 
4650 => the wind swept across the expanse of water , funnelled between the valley sides and moaned despairingly through the railings . 
4651 => no one was to be seen . 
4652 => crystal and i climbed onto the wall beside the road and looked out . 
4653 => the view was immense and magnificent . 
4654 => the high vantage point of the dam showed the whole country laid out like a relief map below us . 
4655 => despite herself , crystal wondered at the edifice : its size , and its might . 
4656 => the dam held the waters in check , in serene calm , and the place was beautiful . 
4657 => i looked out across the scene and noticed a movement , almost imperceptible , on the ground far below . 
4658 => the relief map seemed to be changing , minutely . 
4659 => the ground in the direction of erebos was moving . 
4660 => it lasted only a few seconds but moments later a rumbling noise spread up the valleys towards us . 
4661 => the sound grew to a tearing crackling blast that echoed round the mountains and engulfed us in fear . 
4662 => its another tremor , i shouted . 
4663 => i dont think we should stay here . 
4664 => run ! 
4665 => i pulled at crystals arm as she stood motionless on the wall . 
4666 => she stared , stupefied , across the valley . 
4667 => she turned to me and we grabbed our packs and jumped down to the road . 
4668 => we ran back to the edge of the dam . 
4669 => in the distance , we heard another rumbling crack . 
4670 => it was a long way off but it scared us nevertheless . 
4671 => beside the dam was a small level plateau that was not directly below any higher rocks . 
4672 => we scrambled our way up to the top and stood waiting and listening . 
4673 => all about us was a silence , the same deathly silence that we had experienced the night before . 
4674 => the birds , which had been skimming the lake when we arrived , had disappeared . 
4675 => there was no sign of animal life anywhere . 
4676 => do you think it is over ? 
4677 => crystal asked in a trembling voice . 
4678 => we should stay here for a while , i replied firmly . 
4679 => we stood watching the distance but we could see no movement and we heard no sound . 
4680 => i looked up at the mountains behind the lake and saw what looked like smoke billowing down the side . 
4681 => it was an avalanche . 
4682 => beneath us we began to feel a pulsing vibration . 
4683 => for a few moments , the world went mad and everything that meant life seemed to falter . 
4684 => the ground , which had been so solid and inanimate became a living , breathing monster . 
4685 => the rocks rippled like a sail in the wind . 
4686 => we both lay down and our vision became blurred . 
4687 => dust clouds peeled away from the lakeside . 
4688 => the water in the lake began to heave and giant circular patterns formed across the surface . 
4689 => a great wave rushed out and broke across the dam . 
4690 => loose boulders toppled from high places and crashed into the depths . 
4691 => the quake passed and all became still , too still . 
4692 => i attempted to stand but fell back , dizzy and nauseous . 
4693 => crystal stood up , very slowly , shaking involuntarily ; then she helped me up . 
4694 => we held on to each other for support and walked crab-like , closer to the edge , to look down into the valley . 
4695 => the clouds of dust settled and the water became still . 
4696 => everything continued as though nothing had occurred . 
4697 => but then i saw something and pointed down to the ground in front of the dam . 
4698 => below the wall , we could see the earth begin to change colour : slowly at first , it darkened and stained . 
4699 => the ruddy earth seemed to be bleeding . 
4700 => silently and slowly the water in the lake began to turn and dip . 
4701 => at the same time , the water level in the old streambed began to rise and a new cascade flowed down the old courses . 
4702 => a visible hole appeared , like a small dark tunnel , in the concrete wall at the base of the dam . 
4703 => pieces of concrete began to break away and they crashed down the hillside . 
4704 => they looked tiny from such a height but they were big enough to smash an old bridge as they tumbled down a crack appeared in the wall of the dam , then another and another . 
4705 => we could hear the water as it started to gain momentum and thunder through the break . 
4706 => the torrent became a wave washing down the same hillside where , an hour before , we had toiled upwards . 
4707 => the water level in the lake seemed not to have changed . 
4708 => the dam was great , but the water was greater ; a slowly spinning whirlpool appeared . 
4709 => the revolving mass of liquid moved ever faster until watching it made us dizzy . 
4710 => the vortex deepened and a strange whistling noise filled the air , growing ever louder until it screeched with fury . 
4711 => water appeared at the cracks in the dam and began to spray through them in showers that turned into vast silken rainbows in the sun . 
4712 => the terrible beauty of the scene was stunning . 
4713 => seconds later , the hole became a breach and a complete section of the dam wall collapsed in a mass of flying rubble . 
4714 => a tidal wave of water washed down the hillside and the lake , which had taken so many months to fill , finally emptied itself across the world in just a few violent seconds , carving out a muddy scar as it went . 
4715 => it carried with it everything in its path . 
4716 => the small forest in the valley became a raging green sea and reappeared as a muddy log jam . 
4717 => the tangled , jagged remains of the pipeline , which had bucked and writhed like a dancing snake before it settled , lay broken , hollow and empty , amongst the debris . 
4718 => below us the tide rolled on towards erebos . 
4719 => crystal and i could find no words to say . 
4720 => we stood in silence . 
4721 => the devastation below us was complete . 
4722 => something had ended and crystal began to weep . 
4723 => dont be upset , i said quietly . 
4724 => its all over now . 
4725 => but crystal was crying tears of joy . 
4726 => the water had swept away all that was bad and now she could return home renewed . 
4727 => she knew that her part in the story was almost over . 
4728 => she dried her eyes and turned to me . 
4729 => we must go , harry , she whispered hoarsely , and i will go home and you must go home too . 
4730 => crystal gave me a friendly hug and we turned to walk across the hills hand in hand . 
4731 => we began our journey to the heartland . 
4732 => we were the two companions . 
4733 => somehow , we knew it was over and we no longer felt any danger . 
4734 => our hearts felt light , exhilaration filled our veins , and i sang a walking song that i had known for years . 
4735 => crystal joined with me as we paced the dusty crumpled road away from the disaster . 
4736 => ***** unknown to the two home bound travellers the wave of water had destroyed more than the dam and the pipeline . 
4737 => far below , in the forest , the follower had been watching and waiting for them . 
4738 => he had seen the wall of water before he heard it but could not avoid it . 
4739 => no living thing could have survived such an overwhelming wave . 
4740 => further away still , the waters from the lake had poured into a great fissure that had opened during the earthquake . 
4741 => the freshwater tide flooded down into the tunnels of erebos . 
4742 => the house had collapsed into the old mines in a noxious fiery destruction and lay crushed and ruined in the boiling pools of lava that erupted from the gaping wounds in the earth . 
4743 => the water flooded across the whole red , smoking furnace and quenched the turbulent molten rock in a mass of steaming ferment . 
4744 => a boiling lake formed where the house had been and slowly cooled . 
4745 => the lava flows had filled the old tunnels and the secret of erebos was lost forever . 
4746 => ***** beyond the valleys of the highland and across the dusty arid plains a sad farmer and his wife sat by the old farm pond , now dry . 
4747 => the lady was crying but her tears , too , were dry . 
4748 => the man looked old , slouched and weary with worry . 
4749 => the river , that had once run close by , had disappeared . 
4750 => there were two worn-out suitcases beside the couple and in the yard was the rusty car , ready to go . 
4751 => the early autumn sun was hazy and all about them was the incessant buzzing of insects . 
4752 => the man slowly raised his head . 
4753 => he shook it as though he was dispelling a wrong thought . 
4754 => a moment later , he leapt up and ran to the river bank . 
4755 => the man began to dance and the years dropped away . 
4756 => below him , in the foul ditch , the sand was growing damp . 
4757 => a tiny trickle of clear liquid snaked and oozed into a miniature pool and began to fill it . 
4758 => suddenly , and seemingly from nowhere , a bird alighted in the stream and began to drink . 
4759 => the man looked up at the sky and began to laugh a loud , free victorious laugh . 
4760 => he ran to the sad , sombre lady and took her in his arms and kissed her on the cheek . 
4761 => my love , my dearest love , i cant believe it , but its true . 
4762 => come , let me show you , come with me and tell me it is true , and he led her gently to the stream , which , by then , was almost running . 
4763 => she looked into the ditch and once again began to cry but this time the tears streamed down her cheeks . 
4764 => her hands clutched and released the air as she bent down and knelt beside the dusty bank . 
4765 => she scooped a palm full of the miraculous water and put it to her lips , in a kiss of joy . 
4766 => ***** crystal and i walked across the snowy mountains for three long days and nights . 
4767 => we travelled for many miles along the paths , through the foothills and down into the heartland . 
4768 => the disaster that had befallen the place became clear as we found our way through the old farmsteads and crossed the blasted plains . 
4769 => the trees were skeletal and the fields resembled a desert . 
4770 => when the rains arrived they aggravated the pain . 
4771 => the early equinoctial autumn storms had washed away the topsoil and silt blocked all the ditches . 
4772 => the rainwater had soaked straight through the parched brown earth and run off into the brackish ponds , where no good was to be had from it . 
4773 => the further we travelled towards crystals home , the more desolate the scenery became . 
4774 => all of the farms were empty and many had begun the slow disintegration into ruins . 
4775 => but we knew that the river was already renewing the land in the distance behind us , and it was slowly filling and reclaiming the country that relied upon it for life . 
4776 => the water would soon begin to heal the scars and bring a new spring . 
4777 => road and river met at an old brick bridge that spanned the waters . 
4778 => it had always been a meeting place for travellers and the ruins of an old inn stood , a gaunt silhouette , by the roadside . 
4779 => this place marked the head of an ancient canal . 
4780 => dilapidated wharves and workshops stood beside the river . 
4781 => the rusty relics of sluices and a small crane stood abandoned on the quay . 
4782 => the river had been canalised centuries earlier . 
4783 => before the days of cars and lorries , the canal had carried the farmers produce down stream and into the heart of the big city . 
4784 => it was late on tuesday morning when we stopped at the bridge , to rest beneath the warm autumn sun . 
4785 => by the time we arrived there , new waters had begun to fill the old courses . 
4786 => clean streams had already started to carry away the green , dank slime and clear the foul smelling air . 
4787 => a new , fresh perfume of damp earth caressed our senses in place of the old evil . 
4788 => the waters would take a long time to soothe all the wounds of the land , but the convalescence had begun . 
4789 => as we stood and watched , a solitary swan glided down through the empty sky and landed on the smooth waters under the bridge . 
4790 => crystal laughed out loud in her joy . 
4791 => a horse rider approached , in a moving cloud of dust , along the empty road ahead . 
4792 => he rode steadily towards us but the horse suddenly stopped , looked ahead to us and whinnied loudly before cantering onto the bridge . 
4793 => the dust cloud settled to reveal the form of the emerald lord . 
4794 => he looked tired and worn , his brow was furrowed and his finery soiled . 
4795 => the horse whinnied again and shifted about in excitement . 
4796 => at first the emerald lord seemed unclear and stooped but he passed his hand across his eyes . 
4797 => we looked at each other across the gap and then he dismounted and strode towards us . 
4798 => the snorting , steaming horse came straight across to crystal and pressed itself towards her as she held his proud head . 
4799 => go on with you now . 
4800 => go and have that drink , she whispered into his ear and the horse obediently went to drink at the waters edge as the emerald lord approached . 
4801 => he looked like a man in shock . 
4802 => he came silently forward and touched us as if he could not believe we were real . 
4803 => i could not believe you could survive . 
4804 => but you live favoured lives . 
4805 => come ! 
4806 => the emerald lord put out his hands to us and clasped us both in genuine warmth . 
4807 => we were taken aback . 
4808 => i can not believe it . 
4809 => but it is true . 
4810 => once again he stood back and just looked at us . 
4811 => but his weary face had taken on a new life and a broad smile . 
4812 => well , it is done and it is done well , he said . 
4813 => much has already changed in the world since we met last . 
4814 => dr 
4815 => wolfe has gone , we thought he had taken you but he must be alone . 
4816 => perhaps not all is lost after all . 
4817 => but erebos has been laid to ruin , the follower has been swept away and the waters have been freed . 
4818 => you will find that much else besides has changed and all these things have come about because of you . 
4819 => we have done nothing , i said . 
4820 => we are going home , said crystal . 
4821 => that is all . 
4822 => have you come to stop us ? 
4823 => i asked . 
4824 => or take us , or deceive us again ? 
4825 => added crystal , sharply . 
4826 => none of those things , replied the emerald lord laughing . 
4827 => i am not dr 
4828 => wolfe . 
4829 => the words i have spoken to you before have always been true . 
4830 => the words i speak to you now are true . 
4831 => my companions and i want only to help you . 
4832 => indeed , we have helped you , but our help has not always been obvious . 
4833 => we believed you had been taken or killed or both . 
4834 => but i felt sure that you might have escaped . 
4835 => i do not why . 
4836 => the gold lord and the council of the elders agreed that i should search for you and i am to offer you , once again , my assistance . 
4837 => much danger has passed , but still you may need some guidance if you are to return to your homes . 
4838 => i think you know that i am true . 
4839 => i am going home and i am going home now , said crystal but with less distance in her voice than before . 
4840 => well , that is good too , replied the emerald lord . 
4841 => now is the time when good friends must part and go their separate ways . 
4842 => believe me or believe me not , trust me or trust me not but at least let me help you . 
4843 => i bring you each a parting gift . 
4844 => to you , crystal , i will give my horse . 
4845 => in the short time you were together he grew to love you and it is he who has found you here , not me . 
4846 => you so admired him before and he will bear you well . 
4847 => he is a fine beast and will serve you faithfully for years to come . 
4848 => this is a time of hardship and you will need every help if you are to survive the coming winter on your fathers farm . 
4849 => your family is waiting and they need you now . 
4850 => my horse is called neptune and when he is refreshed , let him speed you to them . 
4851 => the emerald lord looked at crystal as if he expected a reply , but she remained silent but turned towards the great horse now standing silently by the bridge . 
4852 => he turned to me and spoke again . 
4853 => you , harry , are many miles from your home and in a foreign land . 
4854 => you will need a guide . 
4855 => let me be your guide , for i know the many ways of journeying with a friend . 
4856 => he speaks some truth , i said to crystal . 
4857 => our ways are not the same . 
4858 => do you trust him ? 
4859 => she asked . 
4860 => yes , i trust him , i replied . 
4861 => even though i do not know him ! 
4862 => i held out my hand to the emerald lord and he shook it . 
4863 => then i must turn away , said crystal softly . 
4864 => my home lies across the plain . 
4865 => i had hoped .. 
4866 => but her voice trailed away . 
4867 => she turned away , went over to the horse and took his reins in hand . 
4868 => crystal patted the beast and the animal followed her obediently across the bridge . 
4869 => on coming level with us , she mounted neptune . 
4870 => i strapped her packs onto the saddle bag . 
4871 => tears were in our eyes . 
4872 => the parting of friends is always sad and we did not know what lay ahead or if we would ever meet again . 
4873 => good-bye , crystal , i said , looking up . 
4874 => i shall dream of you tonight and remember you tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow . 
4875 => we may not have changed the world , but you have changed my world . 
4876 => i took her hand for a moment and then stepped back . 
4877 => she turned the horse and they began to walk away . 
4878 => when she had reached the other end of the bridge , she turned towards us again . 
4879 => harry , once before you asked me to sing and i couldnt . 
4880 => well the time has come . 
4881 => remember me like this . 
4882 => crystal sat on the horse and sang , i could barely see her through my watery eyes . 
4883 => the water has filled dry ditches and the tears have filled my eyes , the sky so dry and dusty is made cloudy as she cries . 
4884 => new beginnings , old friends , the parting of many ways , yet love and friendship never ends while memories fill the days . 
4885 => for a long while there was silence broken only by the gentle sound of water running through a sluice . 
4886 => then she turned the horse and they walked slowly along the track across the dusty plain . 
4887 => i watched her until she had faded into the distance and was gone from my sight . 
4888 => i saw that the emerald lord watched her , too , and he also seemed sad . 
4889 => chapter nine - going home the emerald lord turned to me and smiled . 
4890 => harry , he said , we need to travel one more time . 
4891 => you and me both , were going home . 
4892 => i looked at him in surprise . 
4893 => but , i thought you were coming with me ? 
4894 => i questioned . 
4895 => yes , thats right , were going home , he reaffirmed . 
4896 => the journeys and adventures that had befallen me had almost put home out of my thoughts . 
4897 => of course , i knew that i had to return , but i could not begin to imagine what would become of me when i arrived . 
4898 => i was still too far away . 
4899 => you dont live on suidhe ? 
4900 => i asked him . 
4901 => no , i do not , he replied . 
4902 => but sometimes i feel that i do . 
4903 => you see , my grandfather was a visitor there , for a time . 
4904 => while he was on suidhe he kept diaries and a journal . 
4905 => when i was just a boy he told me tales of the place and many years later , after he had returned to the mainland , he gave me his books to read . 
4906 => he had always intended to return to suidhe . 
4907 => he used to say that he had unfinished business there and even claimed he left some belongings in safe-keeping . 
4908 => but sadly he never did go back . 
4909 => eventually , he became very ill and when he knew that he would never return , i promised him that one day i would go there in his place . 
4910 => the stories he told me had left me so many impressions of the island that i wanted to go and see what it was really like . 
4911 => in a world of strange coincidences this seemed stranger than all but i kept my caution and turned back to the river . 
4912 => how will we get there ? 
4913 => i asked . 
4914 => i think that our route is clear and the means to travel is already before us . 
4915 => so saying , he stepped down to the river bank and looked along the old canal . 
4916 => the way may not be as free as it should be , but it will suit . 
4917 => i can remember when these wharves were thriving and many craft came here . 
4918 => perhaps they will return one day . 
4919 => he led the way across the road to a series of long abandoned sheds . 
4920 => we opened the half-broken doors of the first shed . 
4921 => all was dusty and dark inside ; cobwebs festooned the ceilings and dirt covered the floor . 
4922 => there were , perhaps , twenty large canoes stacked on racks either side of the shed . 
4923 => they appeared unkempt but serviceable . 
4924 => we chose one that seemed newer than most and took it out into the sunlight . 
4925 => a few minutes spent cleaning revealed an old but solid craft . 
4926 => a second shed revealed a selection of paddles and chandlery . 
4927 => we collected the things that we thought would be most useful : ropes , canvas covers , holdalls , fishing net and many small sundries . 
4928 => the canoe was soon kitted out and we checked that we could lift her between us . 
4929 => we placed the vessel on the water and loaded our provisions . 
4930 => we must have a name for our boat . 
4931 => i said . 
4932 => lets call it crystal ! 
4933 => replied the emerald lord , smiling . 
4934 => the canoe was of the large , open , traditional type and could accommodate two paddlers and their baggage with ease . 
4935 => i placed my duffel bag under the thwart . 
4936 => my companion had brought a spare saddlebag with him , which he stowed in the stern . 
4937 => we boarded the vessel and set off towards the city . 
4938 => we both knew it would be a long journey home . 
4939 => i looked at my fellow traveller in the canoe . 
4940 => he no longer looked like a lord but was just an ordinary man and i felt that i had known him for a long time . 
4941 => what is your real name ? 
4942 => i asked . 
4943 => he gazed at me quizzically and replied . 
4944 => yes , it is time you knew my real name . 
4945 => you can not call me the emerald lord , not here at any rate . 
4946 => he paused and looked me directly in the eye . 
4947 => my name is finder ; you may call me that . 
4948 => but ... 
4949 => i faltered . 
4950 => yes , i know , he said softly . 
4951 => one day i will tell you the tale , but now we have work to do and , also , there is something else . 
4952 => what ? 
4953 => i asked . 
4954 => we must take care . 
4955 => you will not be safe until you reach your island , maybe not even then . 
4956 => the follower is still out there , im sure . 
4957 => but i thought you said he had been swept away ? 
4958 => i never said he had been killed . 
4959 => the follower is not so easily stopped , like any living thing . 
4960 => no , i hope he has been put off the scent for now . 
4961 => but he will keep on trying to find you . 
4962 => lets go then , i said and picked up my paddle . 
4963 => the first mile was uneventful . 
4964 => the old canal was passable with care but the locks were unusable ; water poured over them where the bypass cuttings and sluices had become blocked and broken . 
4965 => other equipment had seized through lack of use , or had been jammed shut by the farmers to preserve the water that had once been so scarce . 
4966 => we lifted our craft out and around three locks and then entered a long twisting stretch of waterway that passed across a flat plain . 
4967 => here , the current was sluggish . 
4968 => debris littered the bed of the river and projected haphazardly from the water , or lurked dangerously just below the surface . 
4969 => we navigated our way slowly through the obstacles to the clear water ahead . 
4970 => the shallow bottomed canoe enabled us to maintain a reasonable speed despite the dangers . 
4971 => finder proved to be as good a travelling companion in a boat as the emerald lord had been on a horse . 
4972 => he knew much about the country we were travelling through and maintained a commentary about the places we passed . 
4973 => he pointed out the features of the landscape and often told their histories . 
4974 => there were few people in the region . 
4975 => it had been a farming area before the water disappeared but the farms were mostly empty and , with their demise , the population had dwindled . 
4976 => consequently , our passage downstream remained largely unnoticed . 
4977 => i had seen the place before , as a patchwork , miniature world , from the heights of the snowy mountains . 
4978 => it had seemed indistinct and like a model landscape from such a distance . 
4979 => the reality of the place was quite different to the impression i had received . 
4980 => the overall tidiness and soft misty quality of myriad farms and fields was really a scene of gentle desolation : of nature attempting to reclaim a piece of the world . 
4981 => but nature requires earth , air , sun and most of all , water . 
4982 => already , the banks of the old canal had begun to green with new growth . 
4983 => the grasses and plants had changed hue within a few days of the river refilling . 
4984 => desert brown filled the distance ahead of us , where the water had barely reached the roots on the river bank , yet behind us the trees seemed almost luxuriant by comparison . 
4985 => a new green world was arising like a phoenix from the sun scorched earth . 
4986 => the rhythm of the paddles , the creak of the wood and the slow rush of water reached my ears like words on the air and even as i thought this , finder began to sing . 
4987 => the end of the day approached and we found a small backwater that could provide both safety and shelter for the night . 
4988 => the long , slow sunset of the plains glowed through wispy , fiery , orange clouds that quietly melded into deep crimson and dulled to a frosty night . 
4989 => we traced the course of the river in the twilight where the twisting silken mists rose up from the water and hung like vaporous wraiths in the evening air . 
4990 => once forgotten sounds had returned to the river bank : the splash of an otter slipping into the current , the rush of a ducks wings as he landed , all emerald and brown in a spray of creamy foam . 
4991 => between these sounds and the occasional whisper of the water wandering by , there was a dark and beautiful quiet . 
4992 => it was not the absolute silence of fear , but the perceptible silence of the countryside , beside the river at night , unbroken by the interference of man . 
4993 => it was an atmosphere of trust , like the gentle caress of fluid whisperings that stroked my mind into perfect pure peace . 
4994 => we talked quietly , long into the night and looked out and into the dark , star-sprinkled sky . 
4995 => it looked like pollen dust on a bed of black velvet . 
4996 => a silver , gibbous moon rose on her journey through the void . 
4997 => i told finder of my adventures in the big city , of my subterranean passage beneath the city streets and the journey across the marshes by boat . 
4998 => he , in his turn , told me how the lords had caught up with us in the small town , beyond the marsh . 
4999 => they followed us through the woods until they found the follower and the strange wolf men . 
5000 => the lonely yew wood had been a busy place that night . 
5001 => tell me about the follower , i said . 
5002 => but finder remained grimly quiet and would not talk about it . 
5003 => wait until it is light , he replied . 
5004 => and dr 
5005 => wolfe , i questioned , who is he ? 
5006 => i believe the dr 
5007 => wolfe you saw is no longer , but we will never know in certainty who he was . 
5008 => he was a clever and a thoughtful man , but he had become corrupted by the boredom of his life . 
5009 => he wanted something more than an everyday existence . 
5010 => he thought that the substance of life should be greater than eating , sleeping and day to day routine . 
5011 => he thought of ordinary life as a prison . 
5012 => i believe that he was wrong ; structure is the key to freedom . 
5013 => the structure of life takes care of your earthly needs and allows you to enjoy a spiritual freedom that does not abide in an uncertain world . 
5014 => in answer to who he was , he was a very old man , much older than the other lords of the double-cross . 
5015 => he had lived at erebos for many years . 
5016 => but he had lived and travelled , far and wide , for many more years before that . 
5017 => of course , he was not known as dr 
5018 => wolfe then , we called him the white lord and he was one of our company . 
5019 => in a way , he was the leader of the lords of the double-cross , but like all leaders he found that he was really just a slave to his people and without them he had no power . 
5020 => that is one reason why he was so interested in your possession ; because he was jealous of the power it appeared to give you . 
5021 => he wished to have a power that he alone could control at will . 
5022 => although he knew about the white crystal and , indeed , he became obsessed by it , he did not understand it and failed to make the magic work . 
5023 => when he discovered that you had the white crystal and that you also possessed the secret that made it work , he needed to be able to use it for himself . 
5024 => he decided to obtain your secret and then well i rather think he sought to destroy you . 
5025 => he showed me the furnace beneath the house , i said . 
5026 => i am sure i would have ended in the flames . 
5027 => do you mean there really was a molten pool ? 
5028 => i had heard of that , and it was finders turn to be surprised . 
5029 => but you could have been killed , replied finder earnestly . 
5030 => i am sure it was his intention . 
5031 => but why ? 
5032 => i can not understand that finder . 
5033 => the more i see , the further i go , the more i realise there isnt any real magic in the white crystal , i said . 
5034 => there is good luck and bad luck surrounding me in equal measure . 
5035 => there is hard work and sweet enjoyment too , but no magic . 
5036 => these things that have happened are just life and the world at work . 
5037 => i do not understand them . 
5038 => i do not have any power . 
5039 => i am just me . 
5040 => perhaps when i started out i wasnt even that . 
5041 => finder had stopped paddling and was looking at me as i spoke . 
5042 => harry , your words are a kind of magic . 
5043 => for the first time , the white crystal has an owner who does understand the spell . 
5044 => what you have said is profound because it is true . 
5045 => but the journey is not over yet , we have far to go and time is of the essence . 
5046 => yes , time is the essence of the thing . 
5047 => i do want to understand . 
5048 => i need to understand for crystals sake . 
5049 => finder looked surprised but continued . 
5050 => erebos was not sleeping . 
5051 => the dam in the mountain had taken the water away and the balance of the place had been disturbed . 
5052 => the earth cracked and the results you saw , and felt . 
5053 => much of what came to pass we had foreseen but the hidden power of erebos was a terrifying surprise . 
5054 => the lords at first feared that dr 
5055 => wolfe had wrought some terror and , when you were found to be missing , we thought that the worst had occurred . 
5056 => but it was not so and there may yet be a chance to start anew . 
5057 => now i think we should turn in and start early tomorrow . 
5058 => i shuddered at the thought of the molten pool that dr 
5059 => wolfe had once intended to be my destiny . 
5060 => we talked a little more about travellers and travelling before settling to sleep , deep and undisturbed by anything but our own dreams . 
5061 => on wednesday morning , i awoke with the sun , although i could not see it . 
5062 => we had moored the canoe in the centre of the waterway , for safety , and i looked out across the water . 
5063 => i saw a wren hopping fitfully through the undergrowth , on the river bank , and as i watched it in delight , some movement beyond the reeds suddenly disturbed the tiny bird . 
5064 => i felt a coldness sweep over me and put out my hand to wake finder , who was still sleeping . 
5065 => he woke up quickly and followed my gaze as something large moved swiftly away , close to the ground . 
5066 => what was it ? 
5067 => i whispered . 
5068 => i do not know , finder replied , with urgency in his voice . 
5069 => we must move on as soon as we can . 
5070 => the day had dawned a cloudy grey . 
5071 => cold mists threaded their silvery strands above the water . 
5072 => the clouds stretched above us in a single , featureless , blanket across the visible world . 
5073 => there was a chill in the air and we could feel that autumn was coming . 
5074 => we made a hasty breakfast and , after washing in the renewed waters of the river , we went swiftly on our way . 
5075 => that day and night passed without event and time was as seamless as the clouds above . 
5076 => we paddled stealthily downstream aided by the current but the canal had become choked by weeds and silt , which frequently forced us to drag the canoe along the banks . 
5077 => our progress was slow , if steady , and by evening we were both ready to rest . 
5078 => despite our tiredness we took it in turns to sleep and watch through the night , mindful of our former visitor . 
5079 => the coldness and the blackness seemed interminable but all remained quiet . 
5080 => on thursday , we bypassed numerous locks where the river descended to the coastal plain . 
5081 => it was hard work lifting and dragging the canoe around the dozens of lock gates and we travelled only a short distance that morning . 
5082 => the journey home had started on a wave of relief and pleasure but it had changed . 
5083 => i felt uncertain and nervous . 
5084 => our progress slowed every day . 
5085 => i became acutely aware of every sound and motion . 
5086 => i searched the banks constantly for any movement out of place . 
5087 => finder , too , had become quiet and watchful . 
5088 => neither of us spoke of it by name , but we both knew that somewhere close at hand were the ever open eyes of the follower . 
5089 => i had hoped to avoid it , said finder suddenly , by taking this quiet and forgotten route . 
5090 => but now i have led us into an inevitable trap . 
5091 => i should have used my wits . 
5092 => this thing has to be faced sooner or later . 
5093 => and it has to be faced by you . 
5094 => when it comes to it , there is little i can do to help . 
5095 => we paddled on . 
5096 => the day was warm and hazy . 
5097 => the air became sultry and still as the afternoon passed . 
5098 => we are approaching the town where you stopped with crystal . 
5099 => the canal goes through the centre of the town and we will be able to replenish our supplies at least . 
5100 => we entered the town early on thursday evening . 
5101 => the place appeared strangely empty and i felt a cool chill pass over me as i remembered the violent wolf-men who had chased us in the woods before . 
5102 => they had come from this town and i did not wish to experience their madness again . 
5103 => several times i heard strange sounds and caught my breath , but there had been no further sightings of wolf-men on our journey so far . 
5104 => finder was weary and determined to rest up close to the town until morning . 
5105 => we made our way out into the marshes on the other side , to a small creek away from the main river . 
5106 => the air hummed with the sound of insects . 
5107 => there was no breeze and the sun shone like a bloody red disc through the haze . 
5108 => billowing cumulus was piling up on the horizon . 
5109 => our evening meal was over when the familiar mists descended in a shroud . 
5110 => but tonight the temperature did not drop and the air grew ever muggier . 
5111 => i could hear a storm grumbling in the far distance and we decided to spread a tarpaulin above our canoe . 
5112 => crouched under the dark hood of canvas , which we had supported with paddles and rope , it was almost cosy . 
5113 => i slept at first , but before long i awoke to the flash of lightning and the crash of thunder . 
5114 => rain drummed down on the tarpaulin , only inches from my head and bounced off the water all around the canoe . 
5115 => it had grown cold and the rain blew in through the open ends of the shelter . 
5116 => finder sat hunched under the cover and faced the night . 
5117 => the lightning flooded the darkness with brief cold flashlight and momentarily exposed the world outside with all motion suspended . 
5118 => we could not see far from our place in the creek but the bank on one side was not more than ten feet away . 
5119 => finder swung the canoe around to face the bank and so avoid the worst of a soaking . 
5120 => the storm was abating but flashes still traced through the clouds . 
5121 => i looked out and then i saw it : a frozen shadow framed by searing light . 
5122 => a tall figure stood on the bank directly ahead . 
5123 => the outline of a wide brimmed hat was clearly visible . 
5124 => the complete darkness obliterated it in a second . 
5125 => finder saw it too . 
5126 => the torch , the torch , whispered finder hoarsely . 
5127 => i dived back and got the torch . 
5128 => finder turned it on and trained the beam at the bank . 
5129 => the place appeared dark and empty at first . 
5130 => suddenly , he caught the thing directly in the beam of light . 
5131 => then i saw the outline of a tall figure , dripping and black and from under the hat , looking out was i looked away and looked again . 
5132 => it was like my own face looking out , but ancient and pained with desperate staring eyes piercing the night . 
5133 => this was the follower , but the follower was me . 
5134 => i felt a sudden terror within . 
5135 => what was this other me and what did it want with me ? 
5136 => i wanted to look aside , to hide away , but i couldnt . 
5137 => i grabbed the torch from finder and held it in the beam of light as it raised an arm and pointed with a gloved hand directly at me . 
5138 => then it spoke and a voice , my voice but somehow strangely thin and ancient , drifted across the water , as though from a dream . 
5139 => save me , come to me , help me , the creature sounded genuinely terrified . 
5140 => shouldnt we go to it ? 
5141 => i cried . 
5142 => stay , stay , do not move , finder put his hand out to hold me . 
5143 => its not you . 
5144 => the shadow figure wavered for a moment and then it turned to look up the bank . 
5145 => lights had appeared in the distance and were moving quickly down the river . 
5146 => the follower stared into the dark . 
5147 => finder whispered , the torch . 
5148 => turn off the torch . 
5149 => i turned it off , just as a new sound filled the night : a howling wolf-like cry . 
5150 => the torches were flaring , flaming sticks that hissed in the rain but did not go out . 
5151 => the wolf-men ran to where the follower had been standing and started to beat at the shadows with sticks . 
5152 => i could hear gasps and cries . 
5153 => sweat was running down my face . 
5154 => save me , save me , came again from the bank . 
5155 => there is nothing we can do , finder said , still holding me . 
5156 => no , no ! 
5157 => i cried . 
5158 => stop ! 
5159 => the wolf-men turned and saw the boat . 
5160 => immediately , they clambered down the bank and into the creek . 
5161 => the light reflected on the water around them as they waded towards us . 
5162 => they wore masks and hoods to cover their faces and strange animal skin coats over their shoulders . 
5163 => finder had not wasted a second but cut the ropes and threw the tarpaulin off the canoe . 
5164 => he handed me a paddle . 
5165 => go ! 
5166 => he shouted . 
5167 => we paddled frantically back towards the main canal . 
5168 => the wolf-men followed , wading through the all-too-shallow river . 
5169 => finder did not out pace them but stopped in mid-stream to face them . 
5170 => the centre of the main canal was too deep to cross on foot and the wolf-men were struggling . 
5171 => finder stood up in the canoe and held up his hand . 
5172 => the flaming torches threw a ghastly light on his face . 
5173 => stop ! 
5174 => do not come closer . 
5175 => i have given my warning , his voice cut through the rain with purpose and power . 
5176 => the wolf-men stopped for a moment , surprised , but then they waded on regardless . 
5177 => they had something gleaming in their hands and held up two long swords that reflected the flare of their torches . 
5178 => again they uttered the awful cries and seemed poised to lunge forward . 
5179 => they were barely six feet from us and the water was up to their waists . 
5180 => finder lifted something from the canoe . 
5181 => i could see it was large and dark in his hands . 
5182 => he held it high in the air and then threw it across the water . 
5183 => the dark shape spread out into a wide fishing net and landed on the wolf-men . 
5184 => finder pulled the rope and the net tightened around them . 
5185 => the torches had dropped into the water and died . 
5186 => i shone my torch on the net . 
5187 => the captives were frantically trying to slash at the net with their swords but it was too late . 
5188 => finder tied a long rope to the net rope and we paddled round and around the pair to truss them in the water . 
5189 => they muttered oaths and shouted at us , but it was to no avail . 
5190 => the swords had both sunk to the river bed and the wolf-men were finally subdued . 
5191 => finder tied the rope across the canal to two trees and stranded the evil pair where they stood . 
5192 => he called out to them : now you can wait til morning . 
5193 => we will send someone to you then . 
5194 => but let me warn you , if we ever meet again , i shall not be so forgiving . 
5195 => if the captives made any reply , we did not stay to hear it what about the follower ? 
5196 => i asked . 
5197 => we may be able to help him . 
5198 => there is nothing to help . 
5199 => but what do you mean . 
5200 => that thing , it was me . 
5201 => i have a right to see it . 
5202 => those foul creatures have attacked it because they thought it was me . 
5203 => they tried to kill it . 
5204 => they tried to kill me . 
5205 => i want to go back . 
5206 => i am going back . 
5207 => i felt my temper rising up . 
5208 => how dare you try and keep me from it . 
5209 => i dont believe you . 
5210 => i want to see the follower . 
5211 => i want to see me . 
5212 => finder did not reply but set a grim face and turned the canoe back towards the bank . 
5213 => i leapt out . 
5214 => there was nothing there . 
5215 => i looked around as best i could with the torch . 
5216 => there was no sign of anything except the foot prints of the two wolf-men . 
5217 => i felt wretched and confused , but got back into the canoe . 
5218 => this is madness , i whispered . 
5219 => harry . 
5220 => believe me . 
5221 => i understand how you feel , but it isnt madness . 
5222 => it is just life . 
5223 => but that thing is me . 
5224 => it haunts me and needs me somehow . 
5225 => i should help it . 
5226 => no , harry . 
5227 => i believe it is an evil thing that will destroy you if it can to get the crystal . 
5228 => i believe it needs the power of that stone to find itself and return back to the living world , a living time . 
5229 => perhaps it will take over your own life and lead you into oblivion . 
5230 => i sighed , exasperated but made no reply . 
5231 => there seemed no sense left in the world . 
5232 => we made our way by torch light back up the canal to the empty town . 
5233 => finder wrote a note to the sheriff and pinned it to the town notice board . 
5234 => lets find a place to stay , finder spoke grimly . 
5235 => at the end of a street there was a stable where we took our shelter for what remained of the night . 
5236 => at first light we left our uncomfortable lodgings and went back to the canoe to check our things . 
5237 => after making a rudimentary breakfast we went in search of people and provisions . 
5238 => there was no-one around . 
5239 => the town seemed almost deserted . 
5240 => most of the shops were closed but we found one to sell us food and drink and batteries for our torch . 
5241 => the shop keeper eyed us suspiciously . 
5242 => where are you from ? 
5243 => i havent seen you about here before ? 
5244 => were just passing through , replied finder . 
5245 => on our way to the big city . 
5246 => cant think why anyone wants to go there at the moment . 
5247 => its much quieter here than i remember , i said . 
5248 => the shop keeper rolled his eyes . 
5249 => which planet have you been on , son . 
5250 => why ? 
5251 => why ! 
5252 => that wretched dam has burst , the pipelines bust and we havent got any water . 
5253 => thats why . 
5254 => and then theres those weirdoes , he continued , attacking people every night . 
5255 => i tell you it aint safe here any more . 
5256 => two people killed this last week . 
5257 => aye , murdered . 
5258 => no wonder everyones packed off someplace else . 
5259 => you mean the wolf-men ? 
5260 => i asked and i saw him tense . 
5261 => we met them last night down by the river . 
5262 => they wont give you any more bother . 
5263 => we tied them up . 
5264 => the man eyed us both again , disbelievingly . 
5265 => really ! 
5266 => and rolled his eyes . 
5267 => well good day to you . 
5268 => outside the shop we ran straight into the sheriff . 
5269 => he was a worried looking man but with a shrewd eye and tall , a good six inches taller than finder . 
5270 => i dont suppose one of you two is finder ? 
5271 => finder held up his hand in acknowledgement . 
5272 => well , you had better both come with me , then . 
5273 => guess you know what this is about , my names stokes , sheriff stokes , he continued as we walked swiftly to the centre of town . 
5274 => at his office , the note was on the table and there were three other men , each with a rifle . 
5275 => the sheriff sat on the edge of the table and spoke . 
5276 => ok . 
5277 => lets hear it . 
5278 => what happened and where are these wolf-men as you call them ? 
5279 => finder quickly relayed the tale from the night before but without any mention of the follower . 
5280 => you must be a pretty stern guy . 
5281 => from what i hear , these characters are scary and mean . 
5282 => ok . 
5283 => lets go and check it out , but the lad stays here . 
5284 => he comes with us , said finder . 
5285 => again , i was surprised at the authority finder held in his manner and voice . 
5286 => sheriff stokes thought for a moment . 
5287 => ok . 
5288 => i guess you know what youre about . 
5289 => but itll be your responsibility if anything goes wrong . 
5290 => im in no mood for messing . 
5291 => ill soon as lock you both up if i get any trouble . 
5292 => come on guys , lets get this over with . 
5293 => the sheriff got another rifle out of the gun cupboard on the wall and all six of us walked into the street and down to the river . 
5294 => as we walked , i asked the sheriff . 
5295 => who are these wolf-men . 
5296 => what do they do it for ? 
5297 => i mean the first time they nearly killed us . 
5298 => he stopped still , whoa , hold on now . 
5299 => what do you mean the first time ? 
5300 => about a week ago , they attacked my tent . 
5301 => geez . 
5302 => what is it with you two ? 
5303 => yea , i found that tent . 
5304 => spent a day looking for the bodies . 
5305 => well , you can tell me about that later on . 
5306 => we carried on walking and he continued . 
5307 => these guys you call wolf-men are vermin . 
5308 => but they aint local . 
5309 => id know if they were . 
5310 => i know where they come from and i think i know what they want . 
5311 => took me months to find out and i had to do a lot of following of a lot of folk to do it . 
5312 => suddenly , i had an uneasy feeling . 
5313 => the sheriff was wearing a wide brimmed hat . 
5314 => he carried on talking . 
5315 => you see , you guys probably take me for some local yokel of a sheriff . 
5316 => but ive been about a bit and whats more , ive seen the both of you before . 
5317 => he looked down at me , yes , and that girl with the horse . 
5318 => you can tell me about her later as well . 
5319 => we had reached the creek by the river where the wolf-men were tied up . 
5320 => to my great relief , they were still there . 
5321 => a big grin spread across the sheriffs taciturn features . 
5322 => wow . 
5323 => now thats a nice job . 
5324 => all trussed up . 
5325 => look more like chicken than wolf to me . 
5326 => ok guys . 
5327 => jack and dick you keep them under your guns while me and josh get these two outta the river . 
5328 => right oh . 
5329 => mr stokes , they replied . 
5330 => the sheriff cut the ropes holding the net but made the two men stumble up out of the river still caught in their net . 
5331 => they were both shivering with cold . 
5332 => in a short time the two men were out of the net and standing with hands tied behind their backs . 
5333 => ok 
5334 => time to meet these villains . 
5335 => if they are who i think they are , you had better prepare yourself for a shock . 
5336 => the silent jack and dick walked up to the men and took off their hooded masks . 
5337 => well , well , well , said finder quietly . 
5338 => i should have guessed . 
5339 => how on earth ? 
5340 => i exclaimed . 
5341 => jack and dick roughly pulled off the costumes and there before us stood two young men with black leather jackets , black shiny hair , and blue jeans . 
5342 => they both had dark glasses in their top pockets . 
5343 => they were almost carbon copies but for their difference in size , which was comical . 
5344 => one was short and fat and the other was tall and lean . 
5345 => we meet again , bastard , said the tall one and spat . 
5346 => his friend stood silently chewing on gum . 
5347 => ill have my wallet back , i replied . 
5348 => ok . 
5349 => lets have all of you back to the lock up and sort all this out , and sheriff stokes prodded the tall one in the back with his rifle . 
5350 => walk . 
5351 => he sounded like a sergeant major . 
5352 => ***** the day had settled to a steady drizzle as we returned downstream towards the big city . 
5353 => but the sky was showing a thin sliver of brightness on the horizon when we passed the creek where the unfortunate and soaking pair of rogues had cursed and shivered . 
5354 => who are those two really ? 
5355 => i asked . 
5356 => like everyone else weve met on this journey . 
5357 => they are not what they appear to be . 
5358 => ive met them before and two of my colleagues from the double-cross are searching for them now . 
5359 => they are murderers and thieves . 
5360 => and they are mercenaries . 
5361 => they work for the highest bidder . 
5362 => i wonder who was paying them to find you ? 
5363 => they didnt seem too fussed to have you alive . 
5364 => my guess is they stole your wallet just to make sure of who you were . 
5365 => but what they wanted was that pretty stone you keep so carefully hidden . 
5366 => you did well to keep that out of the conversation . 
5367 => our friend stokes knows more about all of this than he lets on . 
5368 => some miles further on , with the thought of another night in the open , i asked the question that had been burning in my mind all through the day . 
5369 => what is the follower ? 
5370 => finder was silent for a moment but then he replied . 
5371 => my father once told me about the follower . 
5372 => he told me it almost destroyed him when he was a young man . 
5373 => i have seen the follower . 
5374 => you have seen the follower . 
5375 => and the follower you have seen is you . 
5376 => maybe , everyone has a follower . 
5377 => sometimes they are a burden and sometimes they become a part of you . 
5378 => sometimes they survive and sometimes they die . 
5379 => sometimes they are good and sometimes they seem evil . 
5380 => maybe we all need a follower in our lives to make us stop and look behind or look ahead . 
5381 => you must decide . 
5382 => no-one else can decide for you how your follower lives in your life . 
5383 => it is down to your own conscience . 
5384 => but i think the follower must go or it will haunt you and destroy you , or worse .. 
5385 => and he paused before continuing . 
5386 => this thing you see is the result of the temptation to live forever , to be the master of time . 
5387 => it grows older and older and older but it can never go back as a young man and be a part of the real world . 
5388 => it sees you and knows you and desires to be you . 
5389 => the temptation returns but the cycle must be broken this time or you will be forfeit . 
5390 => that thing is ageless , ancient and terrifying , but it is not you .. 
5391 => yet . 
5392 => suddenly , i began to see a little chink of light and understanding in what finder had told me . 
5393 => i made no reply but wondered if my follower would shadow me to the end of my days ? 
5394 => was he good or was he evil ? 
5395 => we paddled on in silence . 
5396 => ***** the canal cut through by a circuitous route away from the streams that crystal and i had followed on our outward journey . 
5397 => it curved in a broad path across the plain . 
5398 => many streams fed this part of the river and the people had continued to maintain and use the canal after the construction of the dam . 
5399 => the original purpose , for cargo transport , had changed over the years and very few barges travelled along the old waterway in modern times . 
5400 => we passed many pleasure boats moored near the locks , but they all seemed deserted . 
5401 => the final stretch of river ahead of the big city was empty of any other travellers or their boats . 
5402 => the old passage of the river under the city was forgotten and the channel silted and blocked a long way before the grating that stood at the entrance to the tunnel . 
5403 => the river had entered the marsh . 
5404 => the water was too shallow for paddling so we waded through it , dragging the canoe behind us . 
5405 => the smog bound city sat quietly on the horizon , like some giant grey and pink crab , growing larger with every mile that we travelled towards it . 
5406 => i became aware of a change when we were about two miles from the airport perimeter and in sight of the distant buildings of the outer city . 
5407 => the airport was silent . 
5408 => there were no planes taking off or landing , although i did see some activity at the farther side . 
5409 => the city folk had diverted the approach to the tunnel entrance when they built the airport and the channel curved to the right before it petered out in a bank of silt . 
5410 => we climbed the bank and found the old channel where the river entered the tunnels through the grating . 
5411 => it was a scene of devastation . 
5412 => the tunnel had collapsed . 
5413 => bricks and rubble , mixed with mud and debris , filled dozens of wide trenches that slashed across the airport like the branches of a tree . 
5414 => the fallen tunnels cut the runways in two . 
5415 => looking into the distance , i saw the ruined remains of the old underground river channel . 
5416 => it looked as though some gigantic knife had cut the city in half . 
5417 => the earthquake had struck these parts too and it had released the river from centuries of underground captivity . 
5418 => in one brief and violent movement it had dramatically revealed itself to the unknowing , uncaring city that dwelt so arrogantly and ignorantly above it . 
5419 => the destruction was too great to allow a passage by water . 
5420 => we abandoned the canoe and lifted our possessions onto our backs . 
5421 => i cant believe this is same place where chrissy and i came through . 
5422 => it seems an age away . 
5423 => somewhere just round here we caught fish and cooked them , i told finder . 
5424 => we started walking to the big city . 
5425 => we kept to the line of the river as best we could , but the piles of rubble and destruction prevented us from walking directly along it . 
5426 => we covered the wide flat expanse of the airport . 
5427 => it took hours to clamber across the many small channels . 
5428 => at last we came to the perimeter and climbed through the tumble down security fence into the city outskirts . 
5429 => everywhere , the people of the city were clearing up the mess of rubble , conduits and water that had so surprised them . 
5430 => gangs of men and women laboured to build temporary shelters in place of the broken houses . 
5431 => these tireless working folk , who had put aside their fashion and finery , seemed quite different to the ones i had seen on my outward journey . 
5432 => some of them stopped and looked at us as we passed by . 
5433 => we were completely inconspicuous here . 
5434 => we were just another pair carrying our possessions on our backs and heading for somewhere else . 
5435 => it was the story of the times . 
5436 => i realised then , that the way people dress and behave from day to day does not flow from the soul . 
5437 => they become followers of some ephemeral and slight social fashion . 
5438 => here were the real people , digging for survival . 
5439 => despite their adversity and , maybe , because of it , they seemed happier now . 
5440 => i had probably seen some of these same people angrily driving their now useless cars through the crowded streets . 
5441 => yet i knew that only time , and circumstance , divided these two peoples ; they were still the same . 
5442 => it had taken a disaster : a life threatening shock to the system , to bring out the real citizen , the heartwood , from beneath the veneer of fashion and modernity . 
5443 => in every district of the city , the river had cut across all the main roads and left them in an almost useless condition . 
5444 => hastily erected footbridges enabled pedestrians to cross the old river that had so recently returned . 
5445 => we walked , carrying our loads , through the seven eastern districts of the big city and into the same park where i had stood with the big city gang once before . 
5446 => the green acres were now covered with thousands of tents . 
5447 => it was a city within a city . 
5448 => the scar of the old river ran through it , in a mass of tumbled masonry and rubble . 
5449 => a slight silvery reflection of the waters of the river was just visible beneath the fallen tunnel . 
5450 => looking around , i could see the elegant buildings at the perimeter of the park but the place where the tall modern hotels had been was just an empty space behind a screen of trees . 
5451 => the quake had razed those famous buildings . 
5452 => workmen were busy erecting fences around the heaps of tangled steel and concrete . 
5453 => it looked like a city at war . 
5454 => the skyscrapers were destined never to be replaced . 
5455 => a lesson had been learnt . 
5456 => we came to a dell beside the river , where it had formed into a pool . 
5457 => fallen trees covered the ground . 
5458 => dozens of people were queuing to fill their water buckets . 
5459 => the water hole was buzzing with chatter and we rested by a fallen trunk to eat lunch . 
5460 => while we sat beside the trees , an old woman walked down to the rivers edge and knelt down . 
5461 => she cupped her hands and lifted the water to her lips as she whispered to the air . 
5462 => well , i never . 
5463 => the old woman walked over to us and spoke . 
5464 => i would never have believed it , but the girl was right , you know . 
5465 => and it was me told her it was here ! 
5466 => would you like some food ? 
5467 => i asked . 
5468 => oh , yes , please dear . 
5469 => i havent eaten today . 
5470 => i got a bit lost trying to find the queue , she continued . 
5471 => you know , that girl came and saw me again just to tell me she had found it . 
5472 => found what ? 
5473 => i asked , half guessing the reply . 
5474 => she called it her secret river . 
5475 => said you could still see it in the park . 
5476 => and you would never believe it , never believe it , bless me no . 
5477 => but one day she came round on a horse ! 
5478 => didnt she look a picture ? 
5479 => crystal , i said . 
5480 => it just has to be crystal , and i could not help myself laughing for joy at the thought . 
5481 => at every turn she is there . 
5482 => well i never , the old lady looked hard at me . 
5483 => yes , thats right . 
5484 => yes , crystal . 
5485 => i do hope shes alright , after all this . 
5486 => so do i , so do i , and i looked down into the dell where i had once stood with duffy , crystal and the horse . 
5487 => penny for your thoughts , said finder chewing a piece of cheese . 
5488 => oh . 
5489 => i was just thinking . 
5490 => i had some friends used to live underground near the river . 
5491 => i dont suppose theres much chance they survived all this . 
5492 => the old lady took her leave and shambled off along the edge of the tumbledown masonry that marked the passage of the river below . 
5493 => after our meal , we moved on through the city and passed back through the seven western districts . 
5494 => the weather was warmer in the metropolis , the season less obvious . 
5495 => the air seemed strangely still ; there were no sounds except natural sounds . 
5496 => no traffic choked the atmosphere and people walked down the centre of the carriageway . 
5497 => the city had returned , just for a short while , to the people . 
5498 => we passed a street close to the shopping district and i saw a solitary horse trotting towards us . 
5499 => in this carless city , the horse seemed quite in keeping . 
5500 => the horse looked at us for a moment , whinnied , and then it turned and continued on its way . 
5501 => i recognised the look in its eye and smiled , but i did not speak . 
5502 => it was late on friday evening when we finally arrived at the quayside and the sun already lay hidden below the horizon . 
5503 => the silhouettes of the warehouses and cranes seemed familiar , almost homely . 
5504 => we stood , two quiet shadows , beside the docks . 
5505 => i looked around , remembering . 
5506 => i must try and find the big city gang , i said . 
5507 => i hope they have not suffered in the quake , they all lived in the tunnels . 
5508 => nobody finds us , harry ! 
5509 => said a familiar voice in the darkness . 
5510 => in the gloom of the night i detected figures walking towards us . 
5511 => one approached and stood a few feet away . 
5512 => tuffy spoke again . 
5513 => harry , you have brought some friends . 
5514 => i felt a thrill of excitement flow through me as we stood in the evening dark . 
5515 => one friend , i corrected . 
5516 => i see two , or rather i see one and i dont see the other , if you know what i mean . 
5517 => we need to talk about that . 
5518 => you know about the follower ? 
5519 => i asked , surprised . 
5520 => hes your little old shadow , harry . 
5521 => i think hes kind of like you . 
5522 => but i dont like him , hes just a child . 
5523 => i think you should ask him to leave , or maybe you would like us to ditch him for you ? 
5524 => said tuffy , menacingly . 
5525 => no , you cant do that , hes .. 
5526 => hes ... 
5527 => i stuttered into silence . 
5528 => what harry ? 
5529 => a ghost ? 
5530 => your ghost . 
5531 => i dont believe in ghosts , harry . 
5532 => come over here now and listen . 
5533 => i have a plan . 
5534 => so these are your friends , i should have known , finder muttered beside me . 
5535 => you never stop surprising me , harry . 
5536 => finder and i walked over and the big city gang huddled around us . 
5537 => okay , harry , said tuffy . 
5538 => this is it , decision time . 
5539 => do you want to be yourself or do you want to be followed the rest of your days ? 
5540 => do you want to be free , harry ? 
5541 => do you want to be you ? 
5542 => cause you know you can never find your true friend all the time that thing is around . 
5543 => you need to sort that out or youll be haunted the rest of your days , yer know . 
5544 => of course i want to be free . 
5545 => but i dont want to hurt anyone . 
5546 => least of all least of all who , harry ? 
5547 => asked finder , you ? 
5548 => and dont forget your true friend , harry , said huffy with a sneer . 
5549 => tuffy spoke again . 
5550 => he seemed much older now . 
5551 => shut it huffy . 
5552 => then he turned to me . 
5553 => i never said it would be easy . 
5554 => you just have to believe in yourself , just once . 
5555 => you just have to be you to be free . 
5556 => weve all been there , harry . 
5557 => thats what you see in us . 
5558 => when you came to this city i dont think you knew why , but you knew we were free . 
5559 => and you liked us . 
5560 => and harry , he spoke quietly just to me alone . 
5561 => yes , i answered . 
5562 => chrissy , chrissys free . 
5563 => but only if you are free . 
5564 => tuffys voice quavered as he spoke . 
5565 => yes , i know , i whispered . 
5566 => you know my answer . 
5567 => i will be free . 
5568 => tuffy told us the scheme for the gangs final adventure in the big city . 
5569 => when tuffy had finished talking , finder laughed and seemed to approve , but i was not so sure . 
5570 => i was to be my own bait . 
5571 => friends , harry , said duffy suddenly and everyone turned and stared at him , friends help you do the stuff you know you can do , but never do do . 
5572 => trust me . 
5573 => it was the first time i had ever heard him speak and now i felt speechless . 
5574 => tuffy looked me straight in the eye and said , remember , harry , wherever you go , he goes . 
5575 => he cant help it and thats how we trap him . 
5576 => we go to the city centre tonight and visit the pleasure palace . 
5577 => get the bikes , lads . 
5578 => at tuffys command , the gang disappeared into the shadows and returned with eight old bicycles . 
5579 => what are these for ? 
5580 => i asked . 
5581 => the roads aint what they were , but these will get us there good , said muffy . 
5582 => i got one for your invisible mate too , said huffy proudly . 
5583 => everyone laughed and huffy turned a little pink in the dark . 
5584 => we journeyed in a creaking convoy to the city centre and arrived a little after midnight . 
5585 => the pleasure palace was deserted . 
5586 => the place had been an amusement park , but it closed for repairs after the earthquake damaged the rides . 
5587 => the gang easily broke in through the main gates and rode into the empty car park in some style , and , to my amazement , singing their big city anthem . 
5588 => they left the gates swinging and tuffy led us to a low , dark building , at the edge of the pleasure palace . 
5589 => duffy forced the doors with his gemmy and i entered alone . 
5590 => i had my torch but tuffy told me not to use it unless i had to . 
5591 => the others all left me as i walked to the centre of a completely black space . 
5592 => the dark was so intense that i could almost feel it pressing on my skin . 
5593 => after twenty paces i stopped , then i turned and waited . 
5594 => there was a lesser dark square where the doors stood open and inviting . 
5595 => nothing moved and the silence hummed in my ears . 
5596 => i waited and watched the grey space ahead of me . 
5597 => without senses , i began to lose myself and would have panicked and run out if a shadow had not suddenly appeared . 
5598 => it was a silent black figure in a wide brimmed hat , a deeper black against the dark grey doorway . 
5599 => i thought it was standing still at first , but although there was no sound , the shadow slowly grew and i knew it was approaching the place where i stood . 
5600 => the grey square behind the shadow figure suddenly and silently disappeared and we were in absolute blackness . 
5601 => there was no escape . 
5602 => it was just me and the follower this time . 
5603 => i held up the white crystal in the darkness . 
5604 => it began to emit a thin , pure , white sparkling light . 
5605 => the light slowly grew and , all around us , tiny points of star light appeared in the darkness . 
5606 => the follower emerged , in grey shadows , in front of me , with an outstretched arm . 
5607 => he reached up towards the crystal but stopped with his invisible hand inches from my own . 
5608 => i stayed absolutely still . 
5609 => i stopped breathing . 
5610 => the arm moved forward and the follower deliberately clamped the crystal between his fingers . 
5611 => i felt an icy chill as we touched . 
5612 => i thought my heart would stop . 
5613 => i felt my senses reeling . 
5614 => at that moment i was tested and i felt i should give way , turn and run . 
5615 => but then i caught a glimpse of crystal in my minds eye , smiling down at me and i knew i had to be free ; i knew the tide was turning . 
5616 => the crystal is mine , i said . 
5617 => my life is my own . 
5618 => i will be free . 
5619 => my voice sounded halting , timid and quiet but the sound of it somehow built my confidence and i repeated my words but much louder , much clearer than before . 
5620 => my life is my own . 
5621 => i will be free . 
5622 => at that moment i felt his fingers grip pause . 
5623 => the crystal is mine , i repeated . 
5624 => my life is my own . 
5625 => i will be free , and then , despite myself , i heard my own voice commanding : ego sum dominus temporis . 
5626 => i heard him hiss , nooooo ! 
5627 => but i repeated the words three times : ego sum dominus temporis . 
5628 => ego sum dominus temporis . 
5629 => ego sum dominus temporis . 
5630 => i felt something change in his grip . 
5631 => he suddenly released his hand and the crystal remained aloft . 
5632 => i felt strong , much stronger than anyone , stronger than small the world of men and i heard myself laugh in scorn . 
5633 => but i would not be tempted . 
5634 => i will be free , my voice was stern . 
5635 => i can choose . 
5636 => i am now . 
5637 => i am free , and this time my voice reverberated around the space . 
5638 => ego sum dominus temporis . 
5639 => the glimmering light suddenly flared and all around the hundreds of stars exploded into glaring blinding flares . 
5640 => the follower spun around in a fury , holding his hands over his face . 
5641 => the ancient figure began to produce a wailing sigh that grew into a searing shriek . 
5642 => it ran to the edge of the chamber but crashed into the mirror wall . 
5643 => it turned and ran frantically from side to side , colliding with the walls , shrieking all the while . 
5644 => it seemed to search for the door but , in the hall of mirrors , it was lost in a thousand reflections that cascaded away in all directions . 
5645 => i stood steadfastly still and waited for the end to come . 
5646 => the followers appearance began to change : liquid features slowly filled the vacant shadows beneath the cloak . 
5647 => at first , i saw my own face and hands surrounding me ; the reflections cascading in the mirrors . 
5648 => burning frightened eyes looked out . 
5649 => the face passed through a lifetime in a minute . 
5650 => the ancient man stopped and stared wildly about him and then he looked directly at me and lunged forward to strike at the crystal . 
5651 => i stood my ground , waiting for the blow to fall . 
5652 => but the harry he attacked was only a reflection and a huge mirror shattered into fragments at his feet . 
5653 => the follower fell slowly to the ground and with a despairing sigh he rolled over onto his back . 
5654 => he looked older still and tired and sad . 
5655 => he lay motionless and silent , his features changing as he aged , beyond the realms of mankind , into the kingdom of the ancients . 
5656 => i moved beside him and looked down . 
5657 => the tears dropped down my cheeks . 
5658 => he seemed a harmless , weak old man . 
5659 => his face was wrinkled and small , like a monkey , with fathomless eyes that looked at me across all the years of his age . 
5660 => i felt pity for this super-natural creature who was yet one of my own kind . 
5661 => the skin on his face began to shrivel and he hoarsely whispered to me , to me now , my own destruction . 
5662 => the light faded from his eyes and the black hat sagged over a skeletal form that visibly disintegrated before me . 
5663 => within one long minute it had turned into a heap of grey ashen dust . 
5664 => i stooped down and picked up the hat . 
5665 => at last i understood . 
5666 => the follower was gone and only the crystal was left . 
5667 => only crystal was left . 
5668 => and the crystal was mine . 
5669 => the light faded and i heard the scraping of the door as it opened behind me . 
5670 => the big city gang moved slowly into the chamber and finder came to my side . 
5671 => it is over , he said simply . 
5672 => we all left the scene of death and returned to the dock side . 
5673 => the gang were strangely quiet during the journey . 
5674 => tuffy came up to me and spoke . 
5675 => harry . 
5676 => we must say good-bye . 
5677 => i do not know who you are or why you came here , but i see you have strong friends . 
5678 => they will look after you . 
5679 => but now our time has also come . 
5680 => the big city gang is here today but gone tomorrow . 
5681 => we will leave before sunrise . 
5682 => there is nothing for us in the big city now . 
5683 => the people have changed . 
5684 => they have discovered community . 
5685 => they are not scared any more because that night , when the ground trembled , they were more scared than ever before . 
5686 => there is no place for a gang in a good city . 
5687 => we have all survived but there is no star chamber and our secret ways have been removed without trace . 
5688 => these things , we think , are maybe your doing ? 
5689 => but no matter , we will find a new world , a new place , over the mountains maybe . 
5690 => perhaps we could find the source of this old stream ! 
5691 => we are going , but you may remember us . 
5692 => good-bye harry ! 
5693 => bon voyage . 
5694 => and remember , you are free . 
5695 => there was a murmur from the others as they sank into the shadows . 
5696 => good-bye ! 
5697 => i blurted out . 
5698 => go to the mountains and good luck go with you . 
5699 => i felt something well up inside me . 
5700 => i wanted to follow them , to belong again , as i had that night , once before . 
5701 => but they were gone and a sudden sorrow settled over me as i stared after them into the night . 
5702 => the shadows had melted away and i heard no reply . 
5703 => i felt saddened that the big city gang had been forced to leave , but i was relieved that they were all well . 
5704 => finder remained quiet for a time and looked away , out towards the sea . 
5705 => the night breeze was chill and the salty wind dried my eyes as i too looked out to where suidhe , my home , lay cloaked in darkness . 
5706 => we walked through the silent streets to the ferry terminal . 
5707 => it was closed and deserted but a sign outside announced the resumption of the island service in the morning . 
5708 => i spent an uncomfortable night half sleeping on a grimy bench . 
5709 => my travelling companion remained silent and often wandered off , seemingly troubled . 
5710 => on saturday , the early morning dawned grey and cool . 
5711 => i looked across the sea towards the island but could not see it . 
5712 => again , as it so often does , mist had descended across the horizon a few miles out from the land . 
5713 => we collected our bags and walked to the door . 
5714 => there was no electric power and the building was dark . 
5715 => the large halls and corridors within , where the bustle of travellers usually roamed day and night , were vacant . 
5716 => a rather dowdy man came to the door and directed us around the side of the building , through the car parks and yards , to where the ferry waited . 
5717 => it looked deserted . 
5718 => we were the only passengers who boarded . 
5719 => the crew waved us aboard and a young seaman told me that we would not need a ticket for this journey . 
5720 => the boat waited until the appointed time to depart , but no other passengers arrived . 
5721 => finder paced the deck and kept looking out across the wilderness of empty car parks and deserted roads while the sailors prepared the boat to leave . 
5722 => he said nothing but i felt sure he was looking for something . 
5723 => surely not the follower ? 
5724 => the ferry slipped its moorings and the engines roared . 
5725 => the vessel moved out into the harbour channel . 
5726 => only then did my companion turn and head for the shelter of the cabin . 
5727 => a squall of rain splattered across the decks as we opened the door to the stairway below . 
5728 => we descended to the saloon . 
5729 => five silent men sat on the benches surrounding the wall and looked almost statuesque . 
5730 => on the sight of his friends , finder burst into a smile and strode forward open armed to meet them . 
5731 => they all stood and the lords of the double-cross , dressed now in plain clothes , greeted each other in silence . 
5732 => the port was fading from view behind a wall of approaching rain . 
5733 => ahead , the clouds clung to the sea . 
5734 => the boat moved on and it seemed as if the world outside the vessel was just a dream . 
5735 => a few minutes later , the big city had disappeared behind but the island was not yet revealed ahead . 
5736 => the isolation of this empty place on the ocean filled me with some strange foreboding . 
5737 => my mind ached with confusion and tiredness . 
5738 => i sat away from my companions and it seemed to me that i was a part of a larger thing : just one piece in a play that had already been written . 
5739 => it was the essence of dj-vu . 
5740 => the six world worn travellers looked at me and , after a time , the gold lord spoke . 
5741 => harry , he said , your journey is almost over . 
5742 => you will be pleased to return home . 
5743 => do not be surprised by what you find . 
5744 => one day we will meet again in a different place and at a different time . 
5745 => we do not ask anything of you now , except this . 
5746 => when suidhe comes into view , go aloft and return to the island in the same manner as you left it . 
5747 => you will be the guardian of the white crystal for the rest of your days and it will pay you to keep it where it belongs , on the island . 
5748 => some things that appear to change remain the same , just as some things that appear the same are always changing . 
5749 => so it is with life , we grow older but yet we do not . 
5750 => time takes us around in circles of experience . 
5751 => the gold lord was quiet and i could not find any reply . 
5752 => the quiet voice of finder reciting another travelling poem broke through the thin silence that surrounded us . 
5753 => the words seemed old and stony as the minstrel told a final tale . 
5754 => the ferry cruised on through the white fog and a slight shimmer of blue showed across the bows . 
5755 => the rain speckled windows brightened and the boat emerged into the real world again . 
5756 => the showers lay behind , while ahead , the early morning sun burnished the ocean with the golden light that gilds the autumn storms . 
5757 => i felt the blood return to my veins . 
5758 => my head became flushed . 
5759 => something deep and homely welled below the surface of my thoughts . 
5760 => i walked unsteadily up the stairs to the deck . 
5761 => turning towards the bow , i saw the horizon covered in green and grey and blue . 
5762 => it was the cloud-covered hills of the island , my island . 
5763 => this was suidhe , my home , once more . 
5764 => the bracing wind blew across my face but i did not feel it . 
5765 => tears trickled like rain on my cheeks but i was not aware of them . 
5766 => an immense happiness filled me up to overflowing as the familiar shape of the land steadily grew and completed my vision . 
5767 => seagulls chased noisily overhead . 
5768 => i made my way back to the place where i had hidden on my outward journey and thought about the gold lords words . 
5769 => i had not understood , until then . 
5770 => i took the white crystal in my hand . 
5771 => i whispered to the wind : ego sum dominus temporis . 
5772 => even as the island had reappeared , i fell under the spell . 
5773 => one last time , i held the stone in my hand . 
5774 => i did not know why . 
5775 => i walked down to the saloon through the open doors but no faces turned . 
5776 => i wondered if they could see me or was i travelling in a different time ? 
5777 => i went back up to the deck . 
5778 => the wind blew through my hair . 
5779 => i could have laughed out loud in my joy and i waited for my home to return to me . 
5780 => here , now , i could decide . 
5781 => i felt truly free . 
5782 => the ferry entered the harbour and drew over to the dock . 
5783 => the crew secured her as the six lords waited to cross to the shore . 
5784 => i followed behind and found myself walking on the land that i loved . 
5785 => the ground felt firm beneath my feet as i returned to the sea wall and found my alcove . 
5786 => my hand released the crystal . 
5787 => i was worn and tired with emotion . 
5788 => i sat down and my head nodded until i heard the sea sloshing by the harbour wall as if in a dream . 
5789 => i opened my eyes , which had been inexplicably closed . 
5790 => i yawned and blinked and lifted my heavy head . 
5791 => the sky had clouded again . 
5792 => the morning was grey and damp and the musty smell of autumn was in the air . 
5793 => a feeling of dreaming filled my mind like a silent questioner . 
5794 => i held up my head and listened ; all was quiet except the slow wash of the sea and the sound of the wind in my ears . 
5795 => i looked about me . 
5796 => on the far side of the harbour , high on the cliff , by an old house , i saw a solitary figure looking down . 
5797 => something in my memory moved and i wondered who the distant man might be . 
5798 => i sat there for a while watching the boat as the dock workers unloaded the post and cargo . 
5799 => a handful of passengers arrived to board the ferry back to the big city . 
5800 => i recognised all of them . 
5801 => the time i had spent on the mainland seemed to have slipped away . 
5802 => i sat and watched the harbour life , just as i had done before . 
5803 => i felt as if i had never been away , and yet i knew that i had . 
5804 => i put my hand in my pocket to prove it to myself again . 
5805 => there was the hard shape of the brooch that crystal had given me the night we left erebos , when i had given her the old coin from sgurr-cavan . 
5806 => i took out the brooch and looked at it . 
5807 => a small , almost insignificant thing it seemed . 
5808 => simple , gold and in the shape of a fish , it was set with a single glistening stone . 
5809 => i wondered how she was and if i would ever see her again . 
5810 => i stood up and , remembering the lords of the double-cross , i looked around to see if they were still in the harbour . 
5811 => but they , too , had gone . 
5812 => i had not slept much the night before and i began to feel drunk with sleeplessness . 
5813 => it was still early in the morning and it looked like rain . 
5814 => i walked slowly away from the harbour and up the narrow street to my house , at the top of the hill . 
5815 => the curtains were drawn across the windows . 
5816 => my parents were not yet up . 
5817 => i slipped around the back of the house , to the ledge in the garden and to my amazement i found that my window was open , just as i had left it . 
5818 => i heaved my duffel bag in and climbed into the house as quietly as i could . 
5819 => i shut the window behind me and stood in my room . 
5820 => leaving my clothes on the floor , i climbed into the bed . 
5821 => it was the first proper bed i had slept in since leaving erebos . 
5822 => the warm sheets were heavenly . 
5823 => snuggled within them i looked around the small room . 
5824 => my tired eyes were closing . 
5825 => the mantelpiece , the pictures on the wall , the calendar still showing the day i had left , all was blissfully familiar , the essence of comfort , security , home . 
5826 => within seconds i was asleep . 
5827 => chapter ten - two hearts chrissy dismounted neptune and walked along the dusty track towards the farm , her home . 
5828 => she knew that she should be happy . 
5829 => her wishes had come true and yet something still dragged at her feet and made them sluggish . 
5830 => there was doubt in her mind . 
5831 => what would she find when she reached the old house in the fields ? 
5832 => it was not far to go and she was soon close to the familiar places of her childhood , but they had all changed . 
5833 => the sight of the dusty , dry land made chrissy feel sad . 
5834 => the hedges and trees were already brown ; the skeletal leaves half-fallen . 
5835 => there were no birds in the sky . 
5836 => a strange , weary silence weighed heavily upon her ears and oppressed her thoughts . 
5837 => the only sound was the soft fall of her shoes and the quiet clop of the horse . 
5838 => she slowed almost to a standstill as she approached the final corner . 
5839 => chrissy took a deep breath , walked firmly on and the farmhouse came into view . 
5840 => but the sight of the old house took all thoughts of worry from her mind . 
5841 => her heart leapt to be back home and she led the horse into the yard . 
5842 => she opened the creaking door , slowly . 
5843 => just for a moment , she thought the house was empty . 
5844 => her heart faltered , where was everyone ? 
5845 => no one came to greet her and she could hear no sound from within . 
5846 => chrissy walked across the threshold and stood in the gloom of the kitchen . 
5847 => her heart was beating fast now . 
5848 => suddenly , freeway and bess , the two old dogs , raced across the room and jumped up . 
5849 => their tails were wagging and their excited eyes shining with happiness . 
5850 => she threw down her pack and hugged the dogs affectionately . 
5851 => freeway , bess . 
5852 => how ive missed you . 
5853 => you silly old things , she exclaimed . 
5854 => she picked up her bag again and stood silently listening . 
5855 => chrissy looked through the tears that glistened in her eyes and called out : mum , dad , im home , then she waited . 
5856 => there was a hurried clattering of feet on the stairs and the round moony face of her mother stared disbelievingly across the room . 
5857 => her father followed his wife into the kitchen and all three of them stood for a moment in silence . 
5858 => only the dogs moved , chasing their tails and scampering across the room in their excitement . 
5859 => chrissy dropped her bag on the floor . 
5860 => she began to laugh and running to her mother , embraced her . 
5861 => she looked at her father and said : im so happy to be home . 
5862 => everything will be all right now . 
5863 => the dam has gone , father . 
5864 => i saw it go . 
5865 => we stood there and saw it go . 
5866 => you will not believe my adventures . 
5867 => say something , please say something ... 
5868 => her father stood absolutely still . 
5869 => with flickering dark eyes he looked straight at his daughter . 
5870 => then he raised his hands and let out a great bellowing laugh . 
5871 => chrissy laughed with him , and they hugged each other . 
5872 => days later , the early morning sun climbed above the hills in the distance . 
5873 => the familiar backdrop of the snowy mountains glinted in the rosy light . 
5874 => chrissy and her father were already up and planning their day . 
5875 => they had so much to do on the farm . 
5876 => chrissys return had been the catalyst for action . 
5877 => they were engrossed in their plan . 
5878 => together they would build the best farm in the heartland . 
5879 => the crops had failed this year , but next year they would be ready for a great harvest . 
5880 => they stood in the yard poring over a large plan of the farm when the sound of voices broke through the silence and chrissy looked up . 
5881 => she saw a group of bedraggled and weary figures walking along the track . 
5882 => two of them were pulling an old cart piled with bulging sacks and boxes . 
5883 => she recognised them immediately and caught her fathers arm . 
5884 => five youths strolled nonchalantly into the yard . 
5885 => one walked ahead with his hands in his pockets and kicked the dirt with his worn out shoes . 
5886 => he stopped and stood in front of chrissy and her father . 
5887 => freeway and bess stood between them , snarling at the intruders . 
5888 => the dusty city clothes of the youths were incongruous and outlandish in the countryside . 
5889 => chrissy stifled a laugh as she surveyed the five dissimilar lads . 
5890 => they had been supremely confident in the city , but now they were awkwardly scuffling in the dirt of the farmyard . 
5891 => chrissy called the dogs to heel with a whistle . 
5892 => chrissys father began to speak , what the .. 
5893 => , but his daughter interrupted him . 
5894 => tuffy , muffy , huffy , puffy , duffy ! 
5895 => she cried . 
5896 => you cant come here , this isnt a city ! 
5897 => and she laughed with joy to see them . 
5898 => however did you find me ? 
5899 => she asked . 
5900 => tuffy stepped forward and said , rather meekly , crystal , we didnt , he admitted . 
5901 => it was just chance that brought us here . 
5902 => weve been walking forever through this forsaken place . 
5903 => we need a rest . 
5904 => but now that we are here , i just wondered if we could borrow a barn for tonight , just for one night . 
5905 => he stepped back and waited . 
5906 => puffy , meanwhile , had found a pig and the two creatures were holding a staring match over a fence . 
5907 => the pig squealed and puffy turned away and blushed bright pink . 
5908 => it was the first live pig he had ever seen and he just couldnt believe his eyes . 
5909 => you cant stay in the barn .. 
5910 => said chrissy , but you can stay in the house . 
5911 => weve plenty of room . 
5912 => and to her father she said , these are some of my friends from the big city . 
5913 => they can stay , cant they ? 
5914 => she smiled disarmingly as she spoke . 
5915 => chrissys father stood with his hands on his hips watching them suspiciously for a moment and then , relaxing , he said : if chrissy says youre all right , lads , then youd better come on in , and he turned towards the farmhouse as the others followed . 
5916 => you need some breakfast , by the look of you . 
5917 => weve got some fresh bacon and eggs and a cup of tea . 
5918 => a horrified look spread over puffys face . 
5919 => you dont eat them pigs , do yer , mister ? 
5920 => i aint never goin to eat bacon again . 
5921 => no , i couldnt do that . 
5922 => everyone laughed , except puffy , and they all walked into the kitchen , where they sat down at the great table . 
5923 => the big city gang hadnt eaten wholesome food for days and they gorged themselves without talking . 
5924 => after a while , chrissys father broke the silence : listen , he said , we need some help here . 
5925 => theres a lot of work to be done . 
5926 => hard work , mind ; more than i can manage . 
5927 => could you folks stay for a while and lend a hand ? 
5928 => in return well put you up and feed you , but i cant offer much else . 
5929 => oh , we dont need no money , said muffy . 
5930 => weve got a barrow load of that outside . 
5931 => just cant find nothing to spend it on . 
5932 => yea , well work for you , mister , said tuffy , wont we lads ? 
5933 => they all cheered and shouted , the big city gang ! 
5934 => at that moment , chrissys mother walked serenely through the room . 
5935 => she wore a flowing blue robe and her pale face held a perfect smile . 
5936 => she passed by the company without appearing to notice them and stepped out into the yard . 
5937 => all the breakfasters turned their heads and looked after her in silence . 
5938 => after her daughters return , chrissys mother moved into a distant dream world of her own making . 
5939 => but the sound of the river babbling by the yard and the ducks splashing on the pond seemed to be working a cure for her melancholy . 
5940 => her strange cool smile would occasionally break into open laughter as she sat and watched her family and the new helpers working on the dusty dry land . 
5941 => a week after tuffy and the others had arrived , a new tractor and implements appeared in the farmyard . 
5942 => it had all been bought with the casino money that chrissy had brought back with her . 
5943 => even before the big city gang had arrived , chrissy and her father had argued a dozen times about returning the money . 
5944 => listen , mister , said tuffy , i dare say you dont think much of us . 
5945 => but theres no point handing any money back . 
5946 => there aint no one to hand it to . 
5947 => that casino hit the dust and itll be years before they build another , if they ever do . 
5948 => even the big city bank has moved someplace else . 
5949 => chrissy eventually persuaded her father at least to borrow it and return it after they had put the farm to rights . 
5950 => after all , she said , the casino was a place where people went to lose money . 
5951 => the five lads worked hard and long . 
5952 => together , they enlarged the pond to act as a reservoir and channelled new irrigation ditches across the fields . 
5953 => the weeks passed by but the gang did not move on ; there was too much to do . 
5954 => the workers were enjoying the new pleasures of labour . 
5955 => they felt the satisfaction of physical effort and a job well done . 
5956 => the years together on the streets of the city had made them a formidable team . 
5957 => tuffy and chrissys father began to make plans for the future . 
5958 => they bought the abandoned neighbouring properties at a bargain price using the money from the casino raid . 
5959 => under the expert guidance of chrissys father , they prepared everything as best they could for the winter . 
5960 => when we go , mister , said tuffy , youll have to hire some help from somewhere . 
5961 => you could always stay , he replied . 
5962 => no , were city people , not country folk , said tuffy . 
5963 => we can cross the mountains and find another city . 
5964 => we need streets and people , not cows and corn . 
5965 => well see .. 
5966 => well see . 
5967 => the winter months were harsh . 
5968 => the clouds filled the fields with snow and the rivers with rain . 
5969 => the mountains were impassable , so tuffy and the others decided to stay until the cold weather was over . 
5970 => the cold months passed and when the spring came it was bountiful and brilliant . 
5971 => the crops grew in the fields like a green tide spreading across a desert . 
5972 => the new farmers slowly forgot their dreams of a new city as they watched their corn rising in the fields . 
5973 => they found themselves more and more at home in the country . 
5974 => as the weeks lapsed into months they found that they had decided to stay . 
5975 => the five farmers with chrissy and her father formed a co-operative . 
5976 => in the early days of their new life , they lived in a large farmhouse about a mile away from chrissy . 
5977 => slowly , they renovated the other surrounding farms , until each member of the old gang had a farm of his own . 
5978 => ( puffy became a pig farmer  
5979 => ) 
5980 => the memories of their years in the city faded in the new world of the heartland . 
5981 => other people returned to the villages and some went to work on the farms . 
5982 => through hard work and diligence , the community slowly revived , renewed and prospered . 
5983 => there were many hardships and setbacks in those years , but the new farmers learnt their trade well . 
5984 => they put their youth behind them and they stopped using their old gang names . 
5985 => no one who came to the area knew of their past . 
5986 => they slowly metamorphosed into the new farmers union . 
5987 => eventually , they gathered together enough profit to put aside the money they had stolen from the casino . 
5988 => they used this to start a charity to run a local school for a new generation of children . 
5989 => one by one , the members of the new farmers took wives and raised families themselves . 
5990 => all except tuffy who stayed alone . 
5991 => he seemed to be waiting for something . 
5992 => years of hard work brought rewards and the farms grew . 
5993 => the families became wealthy and supplied the big city with cereal , milk and livestock . 
5994 => chrissy and her parents stayed on their own farm , at the centre of the new community . 
5995 => it was a community that had sprung from their efforts and vision . 
5996 => chrissy would ride from field to field through the long summer evenings on her favourite horse . 
5997 => the one the emerald lord had given to her . 
5998 => then one fine day she walked out to find another horse . 
5999 => it had arrived alone in the farmyard and waited patiently for her as she approached . 
6000 => it was a large but very old horse with a scar on its hind quarter . 
6001 => it had travelled many miles to her heartland home but she never knew how it had found her . 
6002 => she cried when she saw old pegasus , because it reminded her of harry . 
6003 => chrissy did not tell all her adventures to her parents or friends . 
6004 => she often remembered the long journey through the tunnel and across the mountains . 
6005 => sometimes , late at night , watching the moon by the pond , she wondered what had become of her travelling companion and friend , harry . 
6006 => hard work put him out of her mind but always the memories came back and they scared her . 
6007 => she had just been a girl then , harry just a boy and it seemed that maybe it was all just a dream , just a teenage fantasy . 
6008 => then she thought of tuffy , now a strong , clear headed farmer and she knew he was waiting for her to decide . 
6009 => if only she could know which way to go . 
6010 => she sat on her bench as the stream trickled by : a babbling melody , like a song , came into her head . 
6011 => hear me , harry , she whispered , hear me , now . 
6012 => and chrissy sang to the far plains and the sea . 
6013 => in the house , her father smiled . 
6014 => history is the password : just cryptic clues to the crossword , answering the questions in time . 
6015 => all knowledge is invented by memories that are tainted , stained by the mystery and crime .. 
6016 => of time . 
6017 => the standing stones have stood so long , the thrones of kings who once were strong , their armies buried beneath these rolling hills . 
6018 => but now the power is diluted , the streams of thought are all polluted , men are poisoned by their selfish wills . 
6019 => make your way , the vision has ended ; love lies lost and undefended , the castle walls fall broken to the ground . 
6020 => the light has dimmed , the mirror shattered , the strength of life lies crushed and scattered ; where are the answers to be found ? 
6021 => in spirits of the future sailing , brighter than the comet trailing above the rolling winter evening skies . 
6022 => trust in love , reach for survival , life returns with your arrival ; see time passing higher as she flies ... 
6023 => turn around and face the future ; find the truth , a new adventure , the journey holds the answer to the dream . 
6024 => take my hand and find a new way ; the passing night will bring a new day , lay beside me and listen to the stream .. 
6025 => .. 
6026 => you are the answer to my dream . 
6027 => ***** my dreams were filled with water . 
6028 => rivers , falls , lakes and breaking dams crashed and then lulled to the quiet call of a distant stream . 
6029 => i heard chrissy singing far away . 
6030 => i woke up suddenly to the sound of my fathers voice calling from downstairs . 
6031 => harry , do get up , its late ! 
6032 => i was in-between sleeping and waking , in that cloudy never-never land where reality is hard to place . 
6033 => but the sight of my tattered duffel bag , on the floor beside the bed , brought my thoughts to order . 
6034 => how long had i been away ? 
6035 => i didnt know . 
6036 => somehow , i had lost count of the days . 
6037 => i was not even sure which day of the week it was . 
6038 => the clock on the desk showed a quarter past eleven . 
6039 => breakfast must have finished long ago . 
6040 => how could i explain where i had been ? 
6041 => who would believe me if i did ? 
6042 => questions filled my head as i got out of bed and dressed . 
6043 => i felt relieved and surprised when i heard the front door open and my father say his usual general good-bye , to whoever would listen . 
6044 => the moment of telling had been delayed , for a while , but why had he gone out without asking me where i had been ? 
6045 => i went downstairs and i felt as though i was suffering from amnesia , only in reverse . 
6046 => i could remember too much . 
6047 => time had passed , things had happened , momentous adventures had occurred and yet , i didnt quite know : had it all been true ? 
6048 => i found that the house was empty and i sighed with relief . 
6049 => the kitchen table was still laid with my place for breakfast . 
6050 => i prepared some food and i ate heartily . 
6051 => the simple familiar place appeared quaint as i remembered the grandeur of erebos . 
6052 => but this small happy house was greater , it was my home . 
6053 => i was back at last , it was real and i felt the tide of relief , building on the shores of my mind . 
6054 => i began to work out how long i had been away , counting the days off in my head . 
6055 => i went to the big city on a saturday and met the big city gang . 
6056 => crystal and i had left through the tunnels overnight on saturday and we spent sunday in the darkness of the underground river . 
6057 => the two of us had crossed the marshes by river on monday and tuesday . 
6058 => we had passed through the small town on the wednesday and that night we stayed in the yew wood coomb but fled from the terrifying wolf-men in the woods . 
6059 => the lords of the double-cross accompanied us through the forest on thursday . 
6060 => the party arrived at erebos on thursday night and there we stayed overnight . 
6061 => we were entertained at erebos on friday but escaped on friday night , which was the night of the first quake . 
6062 => chrissy and i climbed into the snowy mountains on saturday and watched the second earthquake break the dam on saturday afternoon . 
6063 => afterwards , we made our way through the mountains on saturday and sunday , descending to the plains on monday . 
6064 => i parted company with chrissy on tuesday morning , after meeting finder . 
6065 => finder and i travelled downstream through tuesday , wednesday and thursday . 
6066 => shadowed by the follower , we entered the big city on friday where we met the big city gang and where the follower finally met his end . 
6067 => we spent the night in the city and caught the ferry home early this morning . 
6068 => two weeks exactly : so today should be a saturday . 
6069 => the daily paper was in the usual place on the sideboard and i picked it up to confirm the day . 
6070 => yes , it was a saturday . 
6071 => but , no , it couldnt be : the date on the paper was the 3rd september , the day on which i had left . 
6072 => if this was todays paper , i had never been away ! 
6073 => perhaps they had kept this old one . 
6074 => i saw the note that i had written two weeks earlier , it was lying on the floor below the mantelpiece , half hidden and untouched . 
6075 => it must have fallen down . 
6076 => i blushed involuntarily and put the piece of paper in my pocket . 
6077 => i went into the study where my father kept a desk calendar ; it was also set to 3rd september . 
6078 => i began to worry . 
6079 => had my adventure only been a dream ? 
6080 => i ran upstairs to my room and searched for the brooch that crystal had given to me . 
6081 => it was safe where i had put it . 
6082 => i heaved a sigh . 
6083 => i knew i had been there , that we had been together . 
6084 => but somehow time had played tricks on me . 
6085 => strange happenings and magic crystals , ancient legends and old lords : were these things to be understood ? 
6086 => the earthquake , had that been real ? 
6087 => the postman called and pushed some letters through the door . 
6088 => the post always came late on a saturday . 
6089 => i picked them up and nearly dropped them : two were for me . 
6090 => i opened the first letter nervously ; it was from my friend frank , now living in the big city . 
6091 => it had been posted two weeks earlier . 
6092 => it began .. 
6093 => dear harry , we moved in last week and have a house in the housing district , which is district 5 . 
6094 => the city is a wonderful place and one day soon you must come and visit . 
6095 => i will show you all the sights . 
6096 => you will not believe your eyes ! 
6097 => .. 
6098 => and so it continued . 
6099 => the letter was signed : frank . 
6100 => the second letter had unfamiliar handwriting on the envelope . 
6101 => the letter had been addressed simply to harry , the old schoolhouse , oldford , suidhe . 
6102 => i opened it and removed the paper . 
6103 => dearest harry , i arrived back home on the farm yesterday . 
6104 => my mother is not very well but my father is like a new man . 
6105 => the river has really returned now . 
6106 => i just can not believe it and neither can the ducks ! 
6107 => i hope you are well and have arrived safely . 
6108 => how strange it has been , but how wonderful it is now . 
6109 => the farm will take a while to put right , but i gave my father the money from the casino , that should see us through . 
6110 => i have not told them all the stories yet ; they would never believe me if i did ! 
6111 => and they have not asked . 
6112 => my father says it is a miracle and in a way it is . 
6113 => i could go on writing forever , but i dont know where to begin . 
6114 => so i will go now . 
6115 => i have to look after my mother . 
6116 => i shall think of you every day and one day we will meet again . 
6117 => please write . 
6118 => love chrissy . 
6119 => i knew then that everything was true and real , but how , i did not dare to think . 
6120 => the sun broke through the clouds outside and sparkled on the distant sea . 
6121 => i took my jacket and went outside , walking slowly down the road to the quayside , savouring every inch , enjoying every moment of the way . 
6122 => something inside me was elated . 
6123 => i felt light and happy . 
6124 => i sat down by the harbour wall and read and re-read the letter from chrissy while the boats sailed in and out of the harbour below me . 
6125 => i saw old eric making his slow , hobbling way across the quayside , and he came to sit beside me on the bench . 
6126 => what you got there , boy ? 
6127 => he chuckled . 
6128 => love letter is it ? 
6129 => the old man grinned as i blushed and i quickly put the letter away . 
6130 => not still looking for them stones , are yer ? 
6131 => no , i said . 
6132 => i dont think i want to find them any more . 
6133 => we sat together for a while and he talked of the old days at sea , but i could only think of my own adventures and soon went on my way . 
6134 => i decided to walk up sgurr-cavan to the temple of the wind and see if i could understand what had happened so long ago and how i had become a part of it . 
6135 => i felt the weight of the white crystal in my pocket and wondered what was really true and what was false . 
6136 => then i returned slowly to the house . 
6137 => i found my mother and father at home . 
6138 => my heart missed a beat and i hesitated by the door but they barely lifted their eyes as i entered . 
6139 => i told them that i would be going up the hill and made up some provisions . 
6140 => i took my duffel bag from upstairs and went down to the kitchen . 
6141 => who are you going with ? 
6142 => asked my father . 
6143 => no one , i replied . 
6144 => i dont think you should go alone . 
6145 => i will go with you , he said . 
6146 => i havent been up there for years . 
6147 => and somebody has to stop you catching your death again ! 
6148 => at first , i felt affronted by the thought . 
6149 => but i relented and , shortly afterwards , we set out on the walk . 
6150 => the journey to the hill was uneventful . 
6151 => we walked together in silence , for most of the time , and we arrived , dusty but unscathed , at the summit . 
6152 => the two of us stood at the temple of the winds and looked out across the magnificent views towards the mainland . 
6153 => my father broke the silence and said : i had a dream once , when i was about your age , which i have never forgotten .. 
6154 => as he spoke , a figure suddenly emerged at the precipice of the hill , silhouetted on the skyline , in front of the sun . 
6155 => we both froze and stared in silence . 
6156 => in that moment and without warning , i felt scared . 
6157 => the dark figure stood still , watching us and then another joined him , and another and another , until there were six , standing in a curve , at the edge of the clearing . 
6158 => one of the six walked slowly towards us and i recognised something in his manner . 
6159 => i walked forward to meet him . 
6160 => stop , harry , my father called out but i kept on walking . 
6161 => the gold lord strode to meet me and we shook hands . 
6162 => he smiled and i turned and beckoned to my father , who was still standing behind and watching . 
6163 => meet my friends , father , i said . 
6164 => we have already met , harry , said the gold lord , at the council of the elders . 
6165 => we have come to the island to choose a new white lord , said the emerald lord . 
6166 => and so we call upon your father , continued the red lord . 
6167 => to ask his permission to nominate you , harry , said the violet lord . 
6168 => why me ? 
6169 => i stammered . 
6170 => because you have the white crystal , answered the purple lord . 
6171 => if you accept , said the blue lord . 
6172 => there is one condition , spoke the gold lord . 
6173 => the white crystal must remain on the island , where it is safe , and where it will do no harm . 
6174 => suidhe will be its resting place . 
6175 => the white lord is the guardian of the crystal , and the island will be the guardian of the white lord , he added . 
6176 => finder had returned in his finery as the emerald lord . 
6177 => he stepped forward and looked directly at me as he spoke . 
6178 => you need not accept this burden now , he said . 
6179 => i shall remain on the island , for as long as necessary , until your decision is made . 
6180 => i shall tell you of the ways of our order and of the lords of the double-cross . 
6181 => we will go now , but i shall see you again , soon . 
6182 => this is a symbol of faith to call you to the council of the elders . 
6183 => inside , you will find all you need to know . 
6184 => good-bye . 
6185 => so saying , he gave me a small wooden case emblazoned with the double-cross . 
6186 => it contained a gold chain and a medal struck with the same symbol . 
6187 => the case also held a small parchment scroll . 
6188 => i opened the scroll and read : by this act and upon the order of the council of the elders we call upon you to attend in good time at the appointed place with our company where we wish to lay before you our argument in your favour . 
6189 => our meet will convene on friday at sunset . 
6190 => signed the master of the council of the elders . 
6191 => the cleve , suidhe . 
6192 => the lords of the double-cross all bowed before us and retired as secretly as they had arrived . 
6193 => i wanted to ask my father what he knew , how much of a part he had played . 
6194 => i looked at him as he stood there staring out to sea . 
6195 => this is a beautiful island , he said . 
6196 => i love living here , it fills me with contentment and i long for nothing else , except for the happiness of my family . 
6197 => he turned to me and smiled . 
6198 => say nothing now , he said . 
6199 => next week we will go to the cleve and the meet . 
6200 => i think it will become a little clearer then . 
6201 => we stayed for a while on the summit of the sgurr-cavan but soon we walked back to the path . 
6202 => a misty cloud spread across from the mainland as we descended to the coast and oldford . 
6203 => my father and i set out for the cleve on the friday evening . 
6204 => the old building overlooked the harbour and stood on its own , away from the other buildings in oldford . 
6205 => i recognised it as the place where i had seen the man standing above the harbour . 
6206 => an aged butler opened the door and showed us into a small dining hall within . 
6207 => a long , grey , wooden table rested on trestles , surrounded by sixteen chairs . 
6208 => at the centre of the board was a carving of the double-cross and around it the words ego sum dominus temporis were engraved in an old gothic script . 
6209 => there were six chairs along each side and two at each end . 
6210 => the lords of the double-cross sat along the left side and six others sat along the right side . 
6211 => a sign was carved into the table top , in front of each of the six lords of the double-cross : r knowledge , g freedom , e friendship , b truth , p destiny , v faith . 
6212 => all were silent as we entered . 
6213 => the butler indicated our places at one end of the table . 
6214 => the two remaining seats were empty . 
6215 => the letter w with the word reason was carved in front of one and in front of the other was the letter s and the word mystery . 
6216 => everything in the chamber seemed ancient and rustic . 
6217 => dust spread along the shafts of evening sunlight that penetrated through high windows . 
6218 => a small , wrinkled man , whom i took to be the master , stood and bowed . 
6219 => his melancholy , crow-like voice crackled through the hazy , dry air : the council of the elders welcomes you to this meet . 
6220 => let the business commence . 
6221 => the preamble to the meeting was slow and long . 
6222 => i sat and gazed at the company . 
6223 => the sun was setting and the butler entered to light six old candles that stood in grotesque wax covered stands along the length of the table . 
6224 => the light illuminated the faces and sparkled in the eyes of the men . 
6225 => i did not recognise the members of the council . 
6226 => they all appeared very old and somehow unworldly . 
6227 => yet they also had an air of timeless wisdom that shone in their eyes , so clear but so deep . 
6228 => at last , the master turned to me and spoke . 
6229 => i call on you , harry small , who are with us this day , to accept the position of guardian of the white crystal . 
6230 => should you take this burden , then you shall be the white lord of the company of the double-cross : the lord of reason . 
6231 => i am empowered to offer you the whole protection of the council of the elders for as long as that is required . 
6232 => he paused and then looked directly at me . 
6233 => what say you , young man ? 
6234 => he asked . 
6235 => all eyes were upon me . 
6236 => i stood up and looked around the company . 
6237 => i can not reply here , i said . 
6238 => i believe i am not ready . 
6239 => but i propose a solution . 
6240 => why can you not take the white crystal into safe keeping within the council ? 
6241 => that may never be , he said . 
6242 => we are powerful and , as you have seen , our number can be corrupted . 
6243 => it would not be safe for us or for our world if we held the white crystal ; we journey about the world too far . 
6244 => also , our time here is short and the world has long to live after we have gone . 
6245 => the time has come for these mysteries to pass into the modern world and then our place in history will fade to a memory . 
6246 => but why is it safe for me ? 
6247 => i asked . 
6248 => because you are truthful and without ambition for yourself . 
6249 => because you alone have seen the secret of erebos and can understand the power that lurks there . 
6250 => because you faced the follower and now you are free . 
6251 => but most of all , you have discovered the secret place where it is said the white crystal grows . 
6252 => i looked up and remembered the silhouette on the skyline above the sgurr-cavan . 
6253 => the master continued : you shall come to see that the choice has already been made . 
6254 => the council will wish to discuss in camera . 
6255 => you may leave . 
6256 => the butler immediately returned and ushered my father and me to an ante-room . 
6257 => we stayed there for some time while the indecipherable murmurings of the elders droned on in the dining hall . 
6258 => we sat in silence and i almost fell asleep . 
6259 => finder eventually came and requested us to return to our places . 
6260 => time had passed slowly . 
6261 => i looked at the clock , it was a quarter to twelve . 
6262 => we returned to the meeting room . 
6263 => the master stood and spoke . 
6264 => we have decided . 
6265 => we accept your argument and wish only this . 
6266 => the white crystal will remain with you , but our request will remain also . 
6267 => the emerald lord will stay upon suidhe until you reach a decision . 
6268 => these things will come to pass at the proper time . 
6269 => the master sat down , but even as he sat , there came a distant rumbling crack , very faintly borne on the night air . 
6270 => a slight shower of fine powder filtered down from the roof of the hall and we all felt a small but perceptible vibration beneath us . 
6271 => instantly i knew : the earthquake . 
6272 => it was friday night ! 
6273 => the earthquake at erebos had occurred today . 
6274 => strangely , time was returning to itself . 
6275 => i was here and now but yet i knew i was also somewhere far away then . 
6276 => i understood why we had been summoned so late to this meeting all eyes were upon me in that dreary hall but no one spoke . 
6277 => a minute of silence passed and i stood waiting . 
6278 => the company stood with me and the master said in a melancholy voice : it is the beginning of the end . 
6279 => the council remained standing as the butler ushered my father and me from the room . 
6280 => outside , it was cold and i shivered . 
6281 => towards the mainland , i saw brief flashes from an approaching storm across the sea . 
6282 => you have decided wisely , my father said as we walked down the hill . 
6283 => life will go on now . 
6284 => the following day there was a further vibration : the second dam-breaking quake and somewhat stronger than the first , but there appeared to be no damage done on the island . 
6285 => ***** after i returned to suidhe , my life did return to normal and so it continued for many years . 
6286 => the time passed much as it had before my adventure on the mainland . 
6287 => i only sent one short letter to chrissy and i did not know if it was received because i had no reply . 
6288 => despite my good intention , i never made time to send another and so we lost contact . 
6289 => two years later , i went away to a university in a distant town far away from suidhe and the big city . 
6290 => i remained there for three years . 
6291 => i had always intended to return to the island , but after i qualified i found a job working on the mainland , in the big city . 
6292 => my life in the big city was a disappointment . 
6293 => at first , i tried to find some trace of the big city gang , but so much had changed after the earthquake that there was no sign of the places i had known so many years before . 
6294 => i never found the gang and they never found me ; i concluded that they really had gone away across the snowy mountains . 
6295 => i did seek out my old friend frank . 
6296 => to our great joy , we renewed our friendship . 
6297 => after two years in the big city , i obtained a different situation in a provincial town many miles away . 
6298 => in all , i was away for nearly seven years before i finally sailed back across the sea to my birthplace . 
6299 => it was ten years after the adventures of the white crystal and the earthquake , when i finally returned to suidhe . 
6300 => on my arrival , i stayed in my parents house on the hillside . 
6301 => everything seemed smaller , older and simpler than i had remembered it to be . 
6302 => one morning , shortly after i had returned home , i walked down to the small harbour and sat in the old place by the sea wall , as i had done so often , many years before . 
6303 => i waited , expecting to see the familiar form of old eric ambling down the quay , but the sailor never came . 
6304 => i went to the waters edge where the fishermen were working on the boats . 
6305 => wheres old eric ? 
6306 => i asked . 
6307 => the first fisherman looked at me suspiciously . 
6308 => who ? 
6309 => he replied . 
6310 => another , older man , looked up and took the pipe from between his teeth . 
6311 => you wont find old eric here , young man , he said . 
6312 => not these five years past . 
6313 => i understood that he had died . 
6314 => i felt saddened by the news and i returned to the bench where the old salt used to sit and watch the scene . 
6315 => while i was sitting by the harbour wall , a man did approach . 
6316 => at first , i did not recognise him . 
6317 => he stood before me and smiled . 
6318 => it was finder . 
6319 => he seemed much older than the memory i carried of him and he also appeared tired and worn . 
6320 => he sat beside me and we looked out across the sea for a while , in silence . 
6321 => harry , a long time has passed , but its good to see you back . 
6322 => you are well ? 
6323 => yes , i replied . 
6324 => i ... 
6325 => but i could not find anything to say . 
6326 => the time will come soon , when i must leave , he said . 
6327 => but before i go , i need to know your answer . 
6328 => we have waited patiently for many years and the old order is passing away . 
6329 => the lords of the double-cross have served their time here . 
6330 => the world is changing and there is no need for us to remain . 
6331 => the white crystal is already old and its power is passing . 
6332 => but the secret of the source needs a keeper until the end , when it will fall into history . 
6333 => i had never replied to the request of the lords of the double-cross , or the council of the elders , because i felt something was missing . 
6334 => the passing years had told me what it was . 
6335 => i turned and looked at finder : i will do it , i said , and gladly . 
6336 => i will stay on this island , now , for the rest of my life , i have no need to stray again . 
6337 => your condition will be met . 
6338 => but in my turn , i make just one request of you . 
6339 => if i am not to leave the island ever again , i still wish to see crystal , if she is willing , one more time . 
6340 => can you ask her to visit me here and let me know her reply ? 
6341 => finder assented and seemed immediately brighter and less weary . 
6342 => one month later he returned again and we met at the same place as before , but this time there were three of us and crystal seemed radiant and delighted . 
6343 => she , too , had changed but i knew , before we spoke , by the feeling inside me , that we had a special place in each others hearts . 
6344 => i could tell by the laugh in her eyes and the warmth of her voice that she shared my thought . 
6345 => we stood facing each other on the quay while finder looked on . 
6346 => chrissy , i said simply , hardly believing she was real , i wanted to give you this . 
6347 => ive kept it with me all these years , just to tell me it was true .. 
6348 => what we did . 
6349 => i pressed the small fish brooch into her palm . 
6350 => oh ! 
6351 => harry ! 
6352 => of course it was true . 
6353 => you knew i would come , didnt you ? 
6354 => you didnt think i would let you down ? 
6355 => and she took out the small coin . 
6356 => i always keep it with me . 
6357 => no , it is i who let you down . 
6358 => i hoped you would come , i replied . 
6359 => but i was scared we may have changed . 
6360 => that is why i never tried to find you . 
6361 => i didnt want to break the magic spell of my memories . 
6362 => it seemed too good to be true . 
6363 => do you forgive me ? 
6364 => silly harry ! 
6365 => she said as she looked at me with liquid eyes . 
6366 => listen , i remember too .. 
6367 => and she sang , her womans voice more beautiful than the girls before it . 
6368 => new beginnings , old friends , the parting of many ways , yet love and friendship never ends while memories fill the days . 
6369 => but now i am here , we are together and the spell is not broken , it is renewed . 
6370 => despite my fears , time had worked for us . 
6371 => i had always thought that time would move us apart but , somehow , it had moved us together . 
6372 => the years had been good to chrissy ; she was a beautiful woman , confident , strong and clever . 
6373 => i took her hand and we hugged each other . 
6374 => we three companions of old shared a day of walking and stories . 
6375 => chrissy and i found we could speak without talking . 
6376 => something deep inside us was shared , our two hearts were indeed as one . 
6377 => chrissy stayed for a week at the old inn , there being no room in our small house , and every day we spent time exploring the island and our memories . 
6378 => finder remained with us that week and we set a date for the small ceremony of investiture into the order . 
6379 => chrissy left with finder and it was to be a long time before we all met again . 
6380 => the six lords of the double-cross and i gathered one early morning , high on sgurr-cavan , at the temple of the wind . 
6381 => there , i became the white lord and guardian of the white crystal . 
6382 => the council of the elders had determined that the only solution to the safe keeping of the future was to give the task of holding the secret to the one person they knew already possessed it , and understood that it was a thing of beauty , not of power . 
6383 => so it was that the white lord changed from the wizard and charlatan , the necromancer and magician , to an ordinary man . 
6384 => at that time , the order changed forever and the council of the elders fell back into memory . 
6385 => with the passing of mystery the strength of eight was broken . 
6386 => reason had taken over . 
6387 => the six were only seen together on one other occasion on the island of suidhe . 
6388 => alone after the investiture , i climbed over sgurr-cavan and scrambled down to the cave entrance that led to the chamber of light that i had seen with frank so many years before . 
6389 => but a mass of fallen rock barred the entrance to the chamber . 
6390 => the roof had collapsed , probably in the earthquake ten years before , and the white crystals were sealed below the earth where they would never be found . 
6391 => there were only two white crystals still left with any power and they were with chrissy and me and their power was ours together . 
6392 => i felt happy and yet sad that such a magical but dangerous place had been destroyed . 
6393 => i walked down from the hill with a lighter heart than i had carried on the upward journey . 
6394 => i have never left this island since that day and i do not believe that i ever shall . 
6395 => i am content to stay here . 
6396 => ***** one other event in my life comes from the old story . 
6397 => one year after returning to the island i welcomed a friend to stay . 
6398 => it was chrissy , and now she lives here with me . 
6399 => the day of her return to the island is one i shall never forget . 
6400 => i had proposed marriage to her , on the last day of her first visit , a year earlier . 
6401 => she accepted , on condition that she would complete the work that she had started on the farm . 
6402 => she had told me that when all was ready , her parents would retire and she would pass the management of the farm over to a co-operative of other farmers that had started in the area . 
6403 => during that year , we wrote to each other every week but never saw one another . 
6404 => my father retired and he and my mother went to live in a small cottage by the harbour . 
6405 => i remained in the house and i became the teacher for our small community , just as my father had done before me . 
6406 => the ferry docked on the day appointed for the marriage . 
6407 => it was my twenty-seventh birthday . 
6408 => i stayed in the house on the hill while my father greeted chrissy and the other guests who had arrived . 
6409 => i looked out of the window and saw many people walking up the street and i went into the chapel to welcome the guests . 
6410 => chrissys mother and father were the first to enter . 
6411 => we had never met before and i greeted them warmly . 
6412 => their fellow farmers from the co-operative followed them . 
6413 => the men each brought with them their families , all dressed in fine clothes . 
6414 => they were an imposing group and yet i felt there was some strange familiarity about the men . 
6415 => they all greeted me like an old friend but i did not recognise any of their names . 
6416 => the next to enter was my old friend frank , who had returned to be best man . 
6417 => although we had rarely met in the intervening years , we had remained faithful friends . 
6418 => my own family , very few , entered . 
6419 => my mother looked proud but my fathers feelings remained hidden , as usual . 
6420 => there followed a number of islanders and friends from oldford and newbridge until the small chapel was almost full . 
6421 => i took my place in front of the altar to await chrissy . 
6422 => there was a moment of silence and the doors opened again . 
6423 => everyone glanced behind . 
6424 => but it was not chrissy . 
6425 => the final two parties i had not expected . 
6426 => a group of six old , white-haired men processed through the door . 
6427 => the first was the master of the council of the elders . 
6428 => everyone in the chapel became hushed as he entered . 
6429 => something in his manner required reverence . 
6430 => the five elderly men followed him slowly . 
6431 => they took their places in silence . 
6432 => in the final party were the six lords of the double-cross . 
6433 => they entered , dressed in fine clothes , each in his special colour . 
6434 => they carried their gold swords in the scabbards at their sides . 
6435 => they looked like noble lords from ancient times and the congregation greeted them with gasps . 
6436 => the gold lord led their procession . 
6437 => they stood three each side of the entrance and held their swords aloft in the form of a ceremonial arch . 
6438 => in the silence that followed , chrissy , radiant and beautiful , walked slowly beneath the swords and up the aisle . 
6439 => after the service , there followed a wedding feast , which we held in the old hall at the cleve . 
6440 => the butler , who had grown very old , opened the door to the party . 
6441 => my father and i had cleaned and decorated the grey and dusty room for the occasion . 
6442 => my friends prepared a great feast , which they spread on the tables , and a band played on the balcony . 
6443 => the guests ate and danced until the night became morning . 
6444 => long before the final dance had ended , chrissy and i made our farewells to those we knew would never return . 
6445 => we said good-bye to the council of the elders ; they were strangers even then . 
6446 => we thanked the lords of the double-cross , each of whom had given a generous gift . 
6447 => we were sad indeed , as we turned last of all to finder . 
6448 => we will go now , he said , and we will not return , for our time here is over . 
6449 => but yours has just begun . 
6450 => the past is our land but the future belongs to you , whom we leave and love so dearly . 
6451 => he took chrissys hand and kissed it gently , then he shook my own and finally he turned to join the others as they left us for the last time . 
6452 => we watched them go ; it was a bittersweet moment . 
6453 => a little later , we took leave of the party and bade them enjoy themselves . 
6454 => we left the cleve , amidst much noise and gaiety . 
6455 => the revellers , particularly , i noticed , the farmers , celebrated the moment . 
6456 => we walked out into the night and i brought home my bride . 
6457 => so it came to pass that the two white crystals returned to the island and were united again . 
6458 => ***** in the years that have passed we have grown to be content . 
6459 => the passage of time has not much affected us and the island remains a haven for peace and a refuge from the modern world . 
6460 => we live here happily now and , above me , in my old bedroom , sleeps my son . 
6461 => i sometimes wonder what he will find in the big city . 
6462 => i have never left the island and somehow i know i never will . 
6463 => i will keep the promise i made without difficulty . 
6464 => i hear much from those i meet and they tell me about the world outside ; that is enough . 
6465 => they say the big city over the water is ever changing . 
6466 => the river , once hidden , runs proudly through the city dividing it and joining it . 
6467 => the people have built twelve beautiful bridges across the waters . 
6468 => the river has trees lining its length and gardens that dip into the waters on either side . 
6469 => the people go there to relax and be friends with each other and the ducks , geese and swans that now live there happily . 
6470 => boats glide under the bridges and barges sail through to the docks carrying cargoes of produce from the heartland farms . 
6471 => the river also supplies the city with drinking water and even in the driest of weather there is enough for all . 
6472 => today , the big city is famous for its beautiful river and elegant bridges . 
6473 => of course , it is still a busy place and full of people , cars and commerce , but somehow , it is a little better now than it was before . 
6474 => the identity of the farmers did not remain a mystery to me for long . 
6475 => the big city gang had gone , but i will never forget it . 
6476 => the farmers and their families are all known to me now . 
6477 => they have told me of their lives in the country and how they helped chrissy to rebuild her fathers farm . 
6478 => tuffy had come alone to the house the day after the wedding and asked to see chrissy . 
6479 => she pressed my hand and went out with him to walk briefly . 
6480 => i had known from the early days of our adventure that tuffy was a suitor for chrissys hand . 
6481 => it weighed heavily on my mind when i realised that for the last ten years they had seen each other almost every day . 
6482 => my respect for tuffy grew from that knowledge and i felt sad as the years passed and he never took a wife . 
6483 => the dam in the snowy mountains remains broken : a symbol of a hopeless past and of the power that exists in this old earth . 
6484 => the big city does not need it any longer . 
6485 => the river runs its natural course through the farms of the heartland , although it is not the same as before and some folks still look back to the old times before the dam . 
6486 => the farms are bigger now , but less isolated ; they have new roads and cars . 
6487 => the river is the central feature of the heartland and it attracts many tourists , who cruise up and down the old canal , now restored . 
6488 => many people stay on the farms in the summer or camp in the foothills of the snowy mountains . 
6489 => the place that used to be erebos has become a holiday resort . 
6490 => there is a large lake that has formed in the grounds of the old house and , bubbling to the surface in the centre , is the famous hot spring of elysium . 
6491 => settlers built a small town with hotels and camping sites on the lake shore . 
6492 => now people go there to take the waters . 
6493 => people invented legends telling of the old man , who lived in the submerged house beneath the lake , and of the mystical caverns below . 
6494 => of course , no one really believes the tales : they are already legends . 
6495 => the snowy mountains remain unchanged . 
6496 => the wild rocky peaks are still home to eagles . 
6497 => wolves can sometimes be heard to cry out on moonlit nights . 
6498 => the shepherds still graze their flocks on the higher pastures during the brief summer months , but there are fewer shepherds than before . 
6499 => a few hardy walkers and climbers spend time in the mountains during the summer , but the essence of the place remains the same . 
6500 => there have been no more earthquakes rumbling and rattling the great stone hills . 
6501 => the great quake , as it became known , seems to have stabilised the region . 
6502 => on the island of suidhe , life continues as it always has done . 
6503 => few new people come to live here . 
6504 => the sea crossing is a protection for the place . 
6505 => many visitors come here in the summer months but rarely find the heart of the island . 
6506 => they come to look at the quaint little towns and to lie on the beaches . 
6507 => they come to escape , not to stay . 
6508 => there are still fishermen who sail out in their boats from the harbour each day . 
6509 => the one ferry still plies the waters , to and fro , but the city folk find it hard to live without cars or television or daily papers . 
6510 => we have none of those things here . 
6511 => it is the lack of those man-made and ephemeral things that make this island a special place to those who live here , although not all the islanders realise it . 
6512 => ***** now i stand by my window in the night and watch across the waves to where the lights of the big city are sparkling on the waters , hovering like tiny insects in the night sky . 
6513 => i look at them , and somehow see beyond them , into the dim distance of time . 
6514 => i feel the icy , cool breeze blow over the sea from the snowy mountains . 
6515 => i know that somewhere , deep below the lake at elysium , there lies the remains of dr 
6516 => wolfe , for he was never found after the earthquake . 
6517 => molten rock and falling stone had sealed all the passages leading to the old mines . 
6518 => i sometimes think about the past , but it has taken on the quality of a dream now and seems to cross the boundaries of invention and reality . 
6519 => i do not know where the future will lead us either , for although i may find the past , i am no longer permitted to witness the future , as i once did with chrissy . 
6520 => so the years pass by and my own son grows . 
6521 => he is barely a child and not quite a man . 
6522 => i think of him in his room . 
6523 => i walk to the window . 
6524 => as i stand and watch the skies , a singular distant light , barely perceptible , traces an arc through the heavens . 
6525 => it is a comet , perhaps ; i can not tell . 
6526 => although i see it now , i know that it has already passed a very long time ago while , since then , the light has been crossing the vast empty distance from there to here . 
6527 => i see it , but it isnt there ; it is a traveller in space and in time . 
6528 => i watch it a moment longer and from it i understand a little more . 
6529 => i leave the open window and sit at my desk to pick up my pen again to write .. 
6530 => .. 
6531 => now , as i sit in my room and look out through the dark window , i can see across to the mainland and the big city . 
6532 => the lights of the city shine and twinkle on the horizon like a distant fairground floating on a sea of black . 
6533 => later , i put down my pen and turn out the light . 
6534 => it is very late ; i have been writing half the night . 
6535 => i go to the window and look out at the first light of the approaching dawn . 
6536 => it is too late to sleep tonight and so i put on my coat and take the old broad brimmed hat from the peg . 
6537 => i walk to the cliffs above the harbour . 
6538 => there , by the cleve , i stand and watch the endless motion of the sea . 
6539 => each wave is different and yet somehow the same . 
6540 => i see a small shadow figure moving on the harbour wall and i feel a cold shiver pass through me . 
6541 => if i go home now , what will i find ? 
6542 => upstairs , in my old room , will the window be open and the bed be empty ? 
6543 => is the white crystal travelling and will the lords of the double-cross soon be gathering ? 
6544 => i sit , unable to move for a moment , and in my minds eye i seem to see , far away beneath the snowy mountains , the wizened face of a strange , white haired old man , looking out into the night from a castle tower and waiting ... 
6545 => but i gather myself together and walk back home . 
6546 => i climb the stairs and open the door to my old room , where i find my son still peacefully sleeping . 
6547 => epilogue white light is reflected high in the skies , invading this earthly space . 
6548 => the comet that landed endures in the eyes captured by one of our race . 
6549 => remember the time you looked in the stone , still fire with a heart of ice ? 
6550 => that truth is together and lives here for ever light in the night of your eyes . 
6551 => the end .

6559 => best wishes stephen morley link to table of contents also by stephen morley moses trod it was the hills that made him .. 
6560 => so begins a drama of contrasts where the characters from two generations intertwine through the life of mark hunter , a child of the second world war whose life takes him from his native cumberland to the city of london encountering music , wealth , women , good times and bad as he struggles to come to terms with his life , his love and so leave the world a better place than he found it . 
6561 => mark is helped on his way through the decades by fellow musicians , business men and bankers , but it is the next generation , the twin daughters of his business partner , and his own estranged family , that hold the keys to understanding his world . 
6562 => beneath this fast flowing story lies moses , a tramp who wanders the streets and hills weaving together the threads of an unfolding drama that brings together the art of beauty , madness , truth , lies , greed and humility in a rich picture of a society that is forever changing and populated by characters searching for an idyll that proves as elusive as it is compulsive .

6570 => prelude vietnam was a frustrating experience for america . 
6571 => she got herself into a far off war that ate up her young men and woman for no apparent gains or motive . 
6572 => sick of the carnage , americans went looking for a scapegoat , and in many cases the same soldiers that were fighting and dying were singled out . 
6573 => chapter 1 low dark clouds raced across the sky driven by a bone chilling wind , accentuating the cold dreary day . 
6574 => the raw wind moaned through the branches of the bare trees , tumbling the last of the fallen leaves along the ground . 
6575 => with its lonesome call , a crow hidden among the big trees in the back of the old cemetery added to the somber mood . 
6576 => toward the front , a small gathering of people stood around an open grave , the cold wind pulling at their warm clothing . 
6577 => the crows persistent calling caught the attention of one of the group , a fiftyish looking man in a long gray overcoat , his head bare . 
6578 => he turned his head in the direction of the birds call looking deep into the gloomy , old graveyard . 
6579 => im glad this isnt way back there , his thought paused , its depressing enough out here . 
6580 => he looked up to the sky and sighed . 
6581 => winters coming , i can smell the snow . 
6582 => he just barely registered what the minister was saying , something about ashes to dust . 
6583 => jesus , what a hell of a place to end up . 
6584 => we goofed around in here for years , and now hes going to be here forever . 
6585 => the man shuddered at the irony . 
6586 => the parson closed the book and nodded to the two men standing back from the official proceedings . 
6587 => shovels in their hands , they moved forward to the open grave , as the cleric turned and walked away . 
6588 => the two men began shoveling dirt into the grave . 
6589 => the sound of the dirt hitting the casket made the man in the overcoat turn from the sound of the crow and stare at the open grave . 
6590 => the man shuddered again and pulled his arms tight to his side , trying to keep the cold dreariness away from his body . 
6591 => there was a pretty blond woman at his side , her arm through his . 
6592 => she leaned closer and rested her head on his shoulder , looking up into his face , honey , its cold , lets go , the woman said . 
6593 => the man was silent , a tear forming at the corner of one of his eyes . 
6594 => honey , the woman said again , im getting really cold . 
6595 => she pulled tighter to the man and shivered . 
6596 => the man slowly looked down to her and spoke . 
6597 => what happened here ? 
6598 => why did it end this way ? 
6599 => manny , let it go . 
6600 => he just didnt fit in , the woman said . 
6601 => why ? 
6602 => something cause that ? 
6603 => what happened ? 
6604 => manny said his voice choking . 
6605 => i remember when we were kids ; we were all such good friends . 
6606 => stop it ! 
6607 => the woman interrupted . 
6608 => cassey , dont you see ? 
6609 => we were a part of this . 
6610 => manny pointed to the grave . 
6611 => i dont see anything , except were standing out in the freezing cold , and youre trying to find someone to blame for billy being dead , cassey said annoyed , and you know what ? 
6612 => it had nothing to do with either of us . 
6613 => billy had the opportunities and he didnt take them . 
6614 => if its anyones fault , its his , so dont even think of trying to hang it on me . 
6615 => im sure he loved you all his life . 
6616 => he never forgot losing you . 
6617 => for christ sakes manny , that was years ago . 
6618 => we were kids . 
6619 => you and i have been together a hell of a lot longer , worked through many issues , and made a family . 
6620 => billy and i had a relationship that was based on the back seat of an old car . 
6621 => why didnt he ever find someone else then ? 
6622 => i dont know ! 
6623 => casseys raised voice caused the minister to turn and look , but the two men filling the grave didnt , like this sort of thing accompanied all burials . 
6624 => maybe he did , and we just never knew about it , she added quietly . 
6625 => doesnt it seem strange to you ? 
6626 => manny asked . 
6627 => when we were kids , we were such an important part of each others lives . 
6628 => now , all of a sudden , were standing here and thirty years has gone by , and we know nothing about billy or who he became . 
6629 => look , he was the one that left to go to that silly , fucked-up war . 
6630 => he left , and i turned to you . 
6631 => to you manny . 
6632 => yeah , i loved him , and to tell you the truth i didnt like seeing him lowered into the ground just now because he never did anything bad to me , he just left . 
6633 => i went on with my life , and he went on with his . 
6634 => its not my fault that his didnt turn out so hot . 
6635 => whose fault was it ? 
6636 => thats what i cant get out of my mind , manny said with great sadness surrounding his person . 
6637 => manny was a handsome man , distinguish looking , well dressed , but the sad look on his face made him look old , beaten . 
6638 => christ , ive never seen you look like this before . 
6639 => what is wrong with you ? 
6640 => cassey asked concerned , looking into mannys eyes . 
6641 => youve been to funerals before ; dont let this one get to you . 
6642 => ive never felt responsible before . 
6643 => death happens , but i cant get over feeling it was my fault this time , somehow ? 
6644 => why does it have to be anyones fault ? 
6645 => cassey returned . 
6646 => life is life , and now hes dead , thats it , boo who ! 
6647 => boo who , thats all you can come up with ? 
6648 => thats your rational ; something happened to billy ? 
6649 => i dont know if it was the war , or after , but he wasnt the same ? 
6650 => it was probably all the drugs , cassey countered . 
6651 => shit , those guys pickled their brains . 
6652 => not that i blame them . 
6653 => it was screwed up , and they knew it . 
6654 => i probably would have done the same thing , you too by the way . 
6655 => he wasnt messed up on drugs . 
6656 => how can you say that ? 
6657 => when he got back , we had the pot . 
6658 => billy said he heard about it over there , but never tried it . 
6659 => shit , the first time he ever smoked any was with art jensen and me . 
6660 => im fairly sure that the drug thing in vietnam was after billys time . 
6661 => i dont know manny because i didnt have much to do with billy after he came back , remember ? 
6662 => i was with you . 
6663 => you were the one that didnt want me associating with him . 
6664 => you were jealous , and if anybody was responsible for him feeling left out , it was you . 
6665 => you were the one that shunned him , you and his old buddies . 
6666 => he goes to war , you guys dont . 
6667 => he comes back and you guys treat him like he doesnt belong anymore , and youve got the nerve to point the finger at me . 
6668 => we were wrong , terribly wrong , and im just starting to realize it . 
6669 => i think he was a hero in that war , manny countered . 
6670 => hard to tell , i never heard much about what he did , or what happened , cassey said . 
6671 => manny turned and looked again to the rear of the old cemetery , wondering why the crow had quit calling . 
6672 => he saw the rows of tombstones marching beneath the trees that got progressively older and larger as they recede into the gloomy depths , and felt a terrible sadness . 
6673 => he never said much , i dont think anyone ever knew . 
6674 => his brother said he was a sniper or something like that , cassey said quietly . 
6675 => manny made a sound of disgust . 
6676 => the golden haired boy , notice hes not here today . 
6677 => they moved a long time ago , maybe they dont know ? 
6678 => the family is always notified , manny said . 
6679 => they never really cared one way or the other . 
6680 => i guess billy was the black sheep . 
6681 => i never told you about the time he saved me out hunting , did i ? 
6682 => billy saved my life . 
6683 => billy saved you , when was this ? 
6684 => cassey looked up into mannys face , concerned . 
6685 => manny started laughing . 
6686 => billy saved me from a deranged rabbit . 
6687 => oh come on ? 
6688 => cassey exclaimed , a look of doubt on her face . 
6689 => ever since youve gone gaga over this guilt thing you dont make much sense . 
6690 => how could a rabbit hurt you ? 
6691 => we were hunting rabbits in that old black pickup we used to fool around in . 
6692 => billy was driving and i was in the back . 
6693 => we put sand in the bed so we could get footing and then chase jack rabbits . 
6694 => one guy would drive and everybody else would stand in the bed and shoot . 
6695 => one night it was just billy and me , and he was driving . 
6696 => i wounded this rabbit , and when we stopped , it ran under the truck . 
6697 => i jumped out and was looking under the truck , and the damn thing came out after me , hissing and hopping on its hind legs right at me . 
6698 => i tried to shoot it , but the gun was empty . 
6699 => i panicked and threw the gun at the rabbit and took off running with the damn thing after me . 
6700 => the rabbit chased you ? 
6701 => cassey chuckled . 
6702 => you ran from a rabbit ? 
6703 => how courageous . 
6704 => damn right , it was wounded and really pissed . 
6705 => i told you , it was hissing at me . 
6706 => id never heard anything like that before and it scared the shit out of me . 
6707 => i was running and the damn thing was right on my heels . 
6708 => a killer rabbit huh ? 
6709 => geez manny , you come up with some good ones , you really do ; ill give you credit for that . 
6710 => im not shitting you cassey , that thing was hopping on its hind legs , hissing and right on my ass . 
6711 => i can remember thinking , feet dont fail me now . 
6712 => i was running and dogging like hell with that crazy rabbit right on my butt . 
6713 => anyway , billy ran after us and shot the rabbit on the dead run with my bow . 
6714 => i pissed my pants from laughing . 
6715 => you sure you didnt piss them from being scared ? 
6716 => youre not kidding me about this ? 
6717 => probably that too , but it really happened . 
6718 => im not pulling your leg . 
6719 => a rabbit couldnt hurt you , cassey snickered . 
6720 => i wasnt so sure at the time . 
6721 => that thing could have bit the shit out of me if billy hadnt shot it . 
6722 => he saved you from a killer rabbit and that makes him a hero ? 
6723 => he reacted immediately ! 
6724 => manny exclaimed . 
6725 => how do you know , it could have been rabid or something ? 
6726 => it was just the way billy was . 
6727 => he was always there when you really needed him , wasnt he ? 
6728 => no , he wasnt ! 
6729 => what do you mean ? 
6730 => i needed him , and he wandered off to some silly war , and i ended up falling in love with you while he was gone ive never heard you say that before . 
6731 => you went with me to get even with him for leaving you ? 
6732 => not to get even . 
6733 => i was lonely and you were persistent . 
6734 => i was second best ? 
6735 => we were kids back then , remember . 
6736 => ive given all my best to you . 
6737 => we are what is important , not some guy way back , whenever . 
6738 => but , dont you see ? 
6739 => he was important to you , as im sure you were to him and he lost that , manny lamented . 
6740 => if i was so goddamn important he would have stayed with me , but he went off to the great adventure . 
6741 => come on , its getting cold , we can talk about this in the car . 
6742 => * manny and cassey walked back toward the car . 
6743 => why are you so intense about all this now ? 
6744 => cassey asked . 
6745 => donny , manny responded . 
6746 => cassey stopped and held manny tighter . 
6747 => do you think theyll send him somewhere dangerous ? 
6748 => i dont know ? 
6749 => i hope not . 
6750 => i dont want the same thing to happen to him . 
6751 => oh manny , dont even say that , cassey said with a shudder . 
6752 => the country learned its lesson and is different now . 
6753 => i pray our son is not expendable , like those guys in vietnam were . 
6754 => its funny you should say that . 
6755 => i mean , billy did his duty and got nothing for it . 
6756 => so now we hope that cant happen again ; because we have a son that might be doing the same thing . 
6757 => does billys life mean any less , or are we overlooking the fact that what happened to those vietnam guys did teach us a lesson and we are just now realizing it because now we have something to lose ? 
6758 => what about what they lost ? 
6759 => manny asked . 
6760 => it was a long time ago and theres nothing you can do about it now , cassey said . 
6761 => but maybe it was my fault . 
6762 => manny , for christ sakes , you had nothing to do with his messed up life . 
6763 => but i think i did , manny moaned , stopping , turning cassey , making her look at him . 
6764 => how is any of this your fault ? 
6765 => she asked . 
6766 => andy mcpherson and bueler , manny said , a tone of disgust in his voice . 
6767 => how do those two bozos figure into this ? 
6768 => the fight , the one that got billy put in jail for six months . 
6769 => he beat the hell out of bueler , he deserved it . 
6770 => it was all a lie cassey , manny said quietly , his head down . 
6771 => theyre the ones that started the whole thing . 
6772 => that goddamn andy was jealous of billy . 
6773 => andy was fighting the draft and billy was all done with that shit . 
6774 => billy was back and those guys were scared shitless about going . 
6775 => you never told me this manny . 
6776 => you mean billy got sent to jail , and it wasnt his fault ? 
6777 => cassey asked incredulously . 
6778 => yeah , we were out drinking beer and vietnam came up . 
6779 => andy was ragging on billy for some war stories , but billy wouldnt say anything about it . 
6780 => andy started popping off about billy not saying anything , saying he was a coward ; didnt do anything in the war and all that . 
6781 => anyway , andy said that he wasnt afraid , that hed go and kick some gook ass . 
6782 => billy kind of laughed and told him that he would never make it , that he didnt have what it took to stay alive . 
6783 => andy got real pissed and billy tried to calm him down . 
6784 => billy said that it was all bullshit and that anyone that went was stupid , because the war was all political and had nothing to do with fighting communism , and to stay the hell away from it . 
6785 => andy was drunk and wouldnt shut up . 
6786 => anyway you know that dumb fuck bueler , hed do anything to impress andy , so he blindsided billy and thats how it started . 
6787 => billy didnt have the club , bueler did . 
6788 => oh shit manny , why didnt you say something ? 
6789 => cassey asked , grabbing mannys arm and stopping him . 
6790 => i , i didnt think it was that serious . 
6791 => christ , it was over in a second and bueler wasnt hurt that bad , just a seriously screwed up nose bleed . 
6792 => andy wouldnt let it go , and next thing we know were talking to the sheriff and that rube was always trying to impress andys dad . 
6793 => when it got to court , i was afraid to speak up because i didnt want to lose my job . 
6794 => andy told me if i told the truth his dad would fire me . 
6795 => i heard the trial was kind of nasty ? 
6796 => im glad i didnt go , cassey said . 
6797 => im glad you didnt either . 
6798 => it was a railroad . 
6799 => that fuckin lawyer , the prosecutor , really pulled some nasty shit on billy . 
6800 => he made billy admit to killing people and all that . 
6801 => old man mcpherson sat there with a smug grin on his face eating it up . 
6802 => he told me that nobody messes with a mcpherson and gets away with it . 
6803 => money talks . 
6804 => billy had a lawyer , added cassey . 
6805 => andrews ? 
6806 => that shit for brains ! 
6807 => he was sucking up to the mcphersons , still is . 
6808 => he knows where his bread is buttered . 
6809 => i cant remember it that well , but i know that he didnt do much lawyering for billy , kind of left him out to dry . 
6810 => i think that was the point of no return for billy . 
6811 => i didnt see him much after that , after he got out . 
6812 => he didnt smile anymore , and was so elusive and then he just disappeared . 
6813 => that must have been the shits , sitting in jail for something he didnt do ? 
6814 => cassey said , sadly . 
6815 => i never did like andy or bueler . 
6816 => cassey looked at manny . 
6817 => so what are you going to do ? 
6818 => find out about billy . 
6819 => oh shit manny , what the hell is there to find ? 
6820 => so he might have got dumped on , so what ? 
6821 => were so intent on glorifying our present heroes , a firefighter stubs his toe and the next morning hes on the today show . 
6822 => dont get me wrong , we need to give credit where credit is due , but we might owe some of those guys like billy . 
6823 => its not going to do billy a hell of a lot of good now . 
6824 => i know , but this is something i feel like i need to do . 
6825 => what if you find something that doesnt make billy look too good ? 
6826 => you could make it worse you know , cassey said . 
6827 => i know that he was a great guy before he went to war . 
6828 => if there is anything bad , it would have to be after , and i want to know why ? 
6829 => manny stated . 
6830 => how do you propose doing all this ? 
6831 => the business runs itself , and i need to find something else to do . 
6832 => ive got good people and ive been thinking of taking some time off for quite a while now . 
6833 => ive never seen much of the country , like i promised myself , and heres a good excuse to do it . 
6834 => sounds like a mid-life crisis to me . 
6835 => arent all men supposed to have them ? 
6836 => apparently ! 
6837 => well , dont you think this is better than trying a younger woman ? 
6838 => a younger woman would be an end of life crisis , mr ! 
6839 => see , im doing the right thing , manny said , as he opened the passenger car door for cassey . 
6840 => * shit , i hate this place when it starts this crap , manny said , looking out the front windshield , as it started to snow . 
6841 => especially this early , he gloomily added as they drove though the large stone and iron gates , leaving the cemetery . 
6842 => cant take another winter , huh ? 
6843 => of course , i hear the same gripe year after year , just about this time . 
6844 => i can not figure out what you like about winter ? 
6845 => manny commented , looking over at cassey with a disgusted look on his face . 
6846 => its peaceful , laid back , manny . 
6847 => it smells so clean . 
6848 => if you would just learn to enjoy the solitude . 
6849 => you got that right , nothing to do and nowhere to go , solitary confinement . 
6850 => manny moved forward in his seat , resting his arms and chin on the steering wheel , peering over , looking intently out through the windshield . 
6851 => look at that , its getting heavier . 
6852 => oh , chill out ! 
6853 => just think the seasons are coming . 
6854 => turkey day , christmas , your birthday , cassey chuckled . 
6855 => had to spoil it didnt you . 
6856 => cant do much about getting older . 
6857 => its not the getting older part . 
6858 => its just such a lousy time of the year to have to celebrate anything . 
6859 => tell you what sport , we can switch . 
6860 => you can have my birthday . 
6861 => how does that make you feel ? 
6862 => actually , better . 
6863 => good , because i wasnt planning on using it anymore because i am concerned about becoming an old bag . 
6864 => ah , old girl , ill never rub your nose in it . 
6865 => thanks manny , cassey said sarcastically . 
6866 => how are you going to go about this billy palmer thing ? 
6867 => you are serious ? 
6868 => yes , im serious , but i dont have any idea how to do it ? 
6869 => well , you read enough detective mysteries , how do they solve the unknown ? 
6870 => lately with computers , but you know my expertise in that area . 
6871 => maybe its time to learn ? 
6872 => doesnt it ever bother you that youre the only one still fumbling around in the stone age ? 
6873 => hey , i do okay without them . 
6874 => manny , your business might be in someone elses name by now , for all you know . 
6875 => i know , i know , its just so degrading to be so pitifully inept , when everyone else just cruises along on those damn things . 
6876 => manny i told you i know , i know , theyre so easy these days , manny sighed and sat back in the seat as it began to snow heavier . 
6877 => i guess its a good time to learn . 
6878 => thata boy ! 
6879 => before you know it youll not be looking like a simpleton anymore . 
6880 => you sure love to pick on me . 
6881 => thats why i married you , and stuck around for so long sweetie . 
6882 => theres always something to do . 
6883 => we used to have some good times in winter , when we were kids . 
6884 => everything was much easier then , cassey responded . 
6885 => were you there the time we set the trap for wyscouski ? 
6886 => it was our porch he bled all over , remember ? 
6887 => oh , thats right . 
6888 => did your dad ever figure out what happened , who did it ? 
6889 => oh , god no ! 
6890 => he would have grounded me . 
6891 => id probably still be locked in my room . 
6892 => was it you or billy that put the rope across the gate ? 
6893 => no , it was weathers , but billy and i iced down the sidewalk . 
6894 => god , you guys darn near killed him . 
6895 => he had black eyes for a month . 
6896 => i was really scared . 
6897 => you were scared . 
6898 => what the hell do you think wyscouski would have done to us if he had figured it out ? 
6899 => you and i probably wouldnt be having this conversation . 
6900 => that , my dear , is a true story . 
6901 => he laughed about it though , when i confessed years later . 
6902 => yeah , he turned out to be a pretty good guy . 
6903 => he sure was a mean s.o.b . 
6904 => when he was young . 
6905 => why did you bring him up ? 
6906 => cassey asked . 
6907 => vietnam , it settled wyscouski down . 
6908 => you said it , he was really mean when we were kids , but after he got back from vietnam he mellowed out . 
6909 => all he was ever interested in after that was playing golf . 
6910 => well , see , youre trying to fit the blame for billy , and theres an example quite the opposite . 
6911 => not really , i never said the war hurt billy . 
6912 => i said it was what happened after he got back . 
6913 => wyscouski was a different story all together . 
6914 => shit , wyscouski has never had to work a day in his life . 
6915 => he used to terrorize everyone because he was probably bored , and flying combat missions took the edge off him . 
6916 => he said he kissed the ground every time he got back safely . 
6917 => i wonder if he has any thoughts on billy ? 
6918 => he must be gone for the winter by now ; youll have to go someplace warm to talk to that guy . 
6919 => thats right , ill have to , manny said , suddenly cheering up . 
6920 => jesus , look at it snowing . 
6921 => i still cant figure out what you like about this shit ? 
6922 => isnt it pretty ? 
6923 => hell no , its depressing . 
6924 => the cold , the snow , or the fact that the golf course is closed for a few months . 
6925 => all of it babe , all of it ! 
6926 => besides , you should be proud of me because im evolving , manny stated . 
6927 => oh this ive got to hear , cassey snickered . 
6928 => seriously , ive moved on to a more reptilian phase . 
6929 => i need to lay out on a flat rock in the sun for a while , before im worth a shit . 
6930 => the comment made cassey burst out in laughter . 
6931 => im going to call andrews , manny added . 
6932 => what do you expect to accomplish there ? 
6933 => cassey asked , still laughing . 
6934 => i dont know , but he didnt represent billy properly . 
6935 => i guess its as good a place to start as any . 
6936 => ill bet he never got over you guys stripping him and tying him up on my front porch , then ringing the doorbell . 
6937 => i know my mother never did . 
6938 => you guys were so mean to him . 
6939 => thats because he was always cheating at everything , especially golf . 
6940 => he just wanted to keep up with you guys . 
6941 => i dont remember him being too good at anything . 
6942 => he wasnt , especially cheating . 
6943 => chapter 2 manny was sitting on a receptionists couch , his hair and overcoat damp , forlornly looking out the window . 
6944 => the window was on a floor high enough so that only the very top of the tree next to the building was visible . 
6945 => he was watching the snow swirl around outside , almost obliterating the tree , some of it sticking to the glass and then melting , god i hate winter , he mumbled to himself , just as the secretary announced that he could go into the office . 
6946 => its been snowing for five days , he grumbled , walking past her . 
6947 => yes , isnt it pretty , she responded , trying to ruin his melancholy mood . 
6948 => im not going for it , these winter weenies will never break me , he vowed to himself as he entered the office . 
6949 => andrews , hows it going , manny asked , extending his hand to the man getting up from behind the desk . 
6950 => not bad manny , andrews returned taking mannys hand , and you ? 
6951 => oh , okay , manny said , sitting in the chair by the desk . 
6952 => he could see the snow through the window over andrewss shoulder . 
6953 => no complaints , manny lied . 
6954 => what can i do for you ? 
6955 => andrews asked . 
6956 => i was wondering what id have to do to get the transcripts of the billy palmer trial , the one where you represented him . 
6957 => that was thirty years ago , what the heck you interested in him for ? 
6958 => he made his own problems you know . 
6959 => is that what you thought of him when you represented him ? 
6960 => manny asked quickly . 
6961 => i did my best for him , andrews said defensively . 
6962 => did you , or were you jaded , or even influenced back then ? 
6963 => say what you mean , manny . 
6964 => i dont remember the trial going billys way . 
6965 => i dont think the truth came out , manny said , sitting back . 
6966 => those vietnam vets , probably all fucked up on drugs , whining and crying all the time . 
6967 => they lost the war and then tried to blame everybody else , andrews lectured . 
6968 => i never heard him complain . 
6969 => why the interest now ? 
6970 => andrews asked . 
6971 => i just got back from his funeral . 
6972 => yeah , i heard he died . 
6973 => he wasted his life and now you want to blame somebody . 
6974 => dont come looking to me . 
6975 => i already heard that one from cassey . 
6976 => im not looking to blame anyone , just curious , thats all . 
6977 => shit manny , after he got back you werent exactly his friend either . 
6978 => no one was . 
6979 => im just wondering if we all werent a little at fault for that so called wasted life . 
6980 => so just get me the transcript and bill me . 
6981 => whats cassey think about all this ? 
6982 => she thinks its my mid-life crisis . 
6983 => could be , you know ? 
6984 => maybe , but i want to find out about billy , see if i can figure out what went wrong ? 
6985 => maybe he went wrong , andrews stated flatly . 
6986 => chapter 3 a young billy palmer , sitting in the witness chair in a crowded court room on any other day would have been a very handsome young man . 
6987 => he had weathered good looks , average height and a strong , sinewy look of endurance . 
6988 => his face looked troubled today , though . 
6989 => his normal confident smile was gone , replaced by a look of apprehension . 
6990 => a mean-spirited , young attorney paced back and forth in front of billy , calculating , formulating a plan to make the ex-marine look as bad as possible . 
6991 => answer the question , mr 
6992 => palmer . 
6993 => have you ever done bodily harm to anyone ? 
6994 => the prosecutor asked , pacing like a hungry animal with the scent of blood . 
6995 => billy looked uncomfortable , squirming in his seat , looking to the jury , then to the judge . 
6996 => mr 
6997 => palmer , answer my question ! 
6998 => the prosecutor stopped , turning quickly , staring at billy , a look of determination on his face . 
6999 => objection your honor ! 
7000 => carl andrews , billys lawyer stated . 
7001 => this is not relevant ! 
7002 => goes to character your honor , the prosecutor replied quickly . 
7003 => objection denied , the judge stated . 
7004 => you will answer the question , she said , looking at billy . 
7005 => your honor , you all know that i was in vietnam , billy answered quietly , looking for sympathy . 
7006 => did you ever seriously hurt anyone ? 
7007 => the prosecutor repeated . 
7008 => they were trying to hurt us , billy said quietly . 
7009 => did you lay in wait for these people you hurt ? 
7010 => it was my job . 
7011 => it was your job to cause harm to others , is that right ? 
7012 => your honor , i object to this line of questioning , the defense attorney whined . 
7013 => your honor , it is relevant . 
7014 => it goes to show that this guys training is the reason we are here in this court room today , the prosecutor said , turning to include the jury in his deduction . 
7015 => you will answer the question , mr 
7016 => palmer , the judge instructed . 
7017 => i was only doing my job . 
7018 => then the answer is yes , you have caused bodily harm , the prosecutor accused . 
7019 => billy sat not moving . 
7020 => your honor , make him answer the question , the prosecutor snarled . 
7021 => mr 
7022 => palmer , either you answer , or i will put you in jail until you do , the judge warned . 
7023 => taking a deep breathe , billy answered , yes , i see , the prosecutor trumpeted , you admit to hurting people . 
7024 => have you ever killed anyone , taken it one step further ? 
7025 => i suppose , billy said with a sigh . 
7026 => you suppose ! 
7027 => you shot at people , but you dont know if you killed them ! 
7028 => we didnt stick around to be sure . 
7029 => a real honorable bunch of guys you must have been . 
7030 => shooting and then running . 
7031 => there were only two of how many people did you shoot at ? 
7032 => the prosecutor interrupted . 
7033 => i dont know . 
7034 => after the first time , did you think about what you had done ? 
7035 => of course . 
7036 => and ? 
7037 => and what ? 
7038 => what did you think , was it right , or was it wrong ? 
7039 => i dont know ? 
7040 => i was just glad i wasnt so scared that i screwed up . 
7041 => you saw no moral issue here ? 
7042 => i mean youve shot at someone , possibly killing them , and you dont see a moral dilemma involved ? 
7043 => no , it was war . 
7044 => how did you feel , the second time you had someone in your sights ? 
7045 => judge i dont see billys attorney finally attempted to intervene . 
7046 => answer the question mr 
7047 => palmer ! 
7048 => the prosecutor shouted , ignoring the defense attorney . 
7049 => i dont know , i dont remember . 
7050 => you just went out and did it again ? 
7051 => it was my job , billy answered calmly , tired of the inquisition so , the military convinced you it is okay to administer violence when you feel it is necessary . 
7052 => what has that got to do with anything now ? 
7053 => billy said , trying to defend himself . 
7054 => everything mr 
7055 => palmer , everything ! 
7056 => its the same issue ! 
7057 => it has to do with violent behavior . 
7058 => you are a trained killer , mr 
7059 => palmer , and five people , the prosecutor pointed to andy mcpherson , bueler , marsha dent and manny sitting in the front row , the witnesses to the fight , then the prosecutor pointed to the sheriff seated a short distance away , and the officer that took the complaint and investigated the incident , all agree that you are a violent person . 
7060 => five nonviolent people tell me you cant control your ferocity . 
7061 => take some responsibility here , mr 
7062 => palmer . 
7063 => you have been brainwashed into thinking that the rights of others do not matter . 
7064 => thats not true , they lied ! 
7065 => billy yelled , starting to stand . 
7066 => the bailiff immediately moved toward billy and billy quickly sat back down . 
7067 => after you killed your first person , why didnt you stop , refused , done something ? 
7068 => the prosecutor continued . 
7069 => you cant do that . 
7070 => it would have been desertion , billy said , shaking his head . 
7071 => why not , the person you assaulted , beat up , refused to go kill ? 
7072 => but , i didnt start it ! 
7073 => but you sure finished it . 
7074 => i had no choice , he was no choice ! 
7075 => just like in the marines , is that right ? 
7076 => the prosecutor had a smug , self-assured look on his face because he was proud of how this was turning out . 
7077 => this grandstanding is fun , im sure showing these people what i can do , he congratulated himself . 
7078 => billy didnt answer . 
7079 => thats just what i figured . 
7080 => ladies and gentlemen of the jury . 
7081 => the prosecutor turned to the jury box with a look of triumph . 
7082 => this man was brainwashed into thinking that it is all right to use force , force to get his way . 
7083 => thats not tru said billy , angrily . 
7084 => nothing further , your honor , the prosecutor interrupted . 
7085 => do you have anything to add mr 
7086 => andrews ? 
7087 => the judge asked . 
7088 => no your honor . 
7089 => the defense attorney didnt even stand . 
7090 => are you sure mr 
7091 => andrews ? 
7092 => this is the last chance youll have to tell your clients side . 
7093 => yes , your honor . 
7094 => very well , the judge said , shaking her head . 
7095 => okay , lets hear the final arguments . 
7096 => the prosecutor walked over to the jury box and leaned on the top rail with both his hands and looked at each of the jurors respectively . 
7097 => ladies and gentlemen of the jury , this trial is about the law and order that we all expect . 
7098 => i have no doubt that the defendant acted out of rage and disillusionment and maybe shame . 
7099 => his recent war experience is much to blame , but the law does not allow for excuses . 
7100 => i feel it is necessary to not only punish this man for his ill deed , but to show him that he must change his thinking and become a member of society again . 
7101 => the only way is for him to lose something and that something should be his freedom for the maximum time allotted by law . 
7102 => we must make the best possible impression on him , for all our benefits . 
7103 => thank you ladies and gentlemen , that is all . 
7104 => the prosecutor walked back to his chair and sat down . 
7105 => mr 
7106 => andrews , the judge said . 
7107 => the defense attorney simply stood and started to speak , not looking at anyone . 
7108 => this man has suffered enough . 
7109 => he has done his duty for his country and we should consider that in our judgment of him . 
7110 => thank you ladies and gentlemen . 
7111 => carl andrews sat down quickly . 
7112 => chapter 4 so hows the computer treating you ? 
7113 => cassey asked as she put her arms around manny who was sitting , working . 
7114 => hey , this isnt bad , but id hate to tackle it on my own , though . 
7115 => thanks for all the help . 
7116 => wouldnt want you doing something heinous to it , out of frustration , would we ? 
7117 => now cassey , ive matured . 
7118 => oh , what happened to the driver i got you for christmas ? 
7119 => that damn thing couldnt find a fairway to save its ass so it got lost in the woods . 
7120 => but this is different , ive got you . 
7121 => so , whatcha got so far ? 
7122 => i found a guy that served with billy and called him today . 
7123 => he said he was billys team partner . 
7124 => hes a publisher in new york , and ive made arrangements to meet with him next week . 
7125 => cant do it over the phone ? 
7126 => i could , but this guy sounds interesting and he was the one that suggested we meet in person . 
7127 => he was really sorry to hear about billy . 
7128 => he said billy was quite the marine . 
7129 => did you read that court transcript i got ? 
7130 => i did . 
7131 => it seemed awfully mean , what they did . 
7132 => was it fair ? 
7133 => no , not in the least , but thats just my opinion . 
7134 => im meeting with amanda pierce , the judge , tomorrow . 
7135 => be interesting about what she has to say after all these years . 
7136 => i also found billys sister in san antonio . 
7137 => that should be a warm one . 
7138 => youre planning this according to the warm spots ? 
7139 => i said i was going to new york , manny said defensively . 
7140 => why are you in such a hurry ? 
7141 => oh , you know what its like trying to get anything done from thanksgiving to new years . 
7142 => well , people like the holidays , gives them a chance to reflect . 
7143 => contemplating going into debt sounds like a good reason to celebrate . 
7144 => i called the prosecutor , senator butt head too , think ill get a call back . 
7145 => nah , im fairly sure hes never liked you . 
7146 => just because i didnt vote for him ? 
7147 => manny , you pushed him into the girls bathroom . 
7148 => he had to go all the way through to get out , remember . 
7149 => the doors only worked one way . 
7150 => well , hold a grudge . 
7151 => grudge , im surprised he didnt go blind , cassey laughed . 
7152 => did old miss akers really open the stall with her drawers down ? 
7153 => yes , she did . 
7154 => damn , i didnt really dislike him that much , poor guy . 
7155 => and you wonder why he doesnt forget . 
7156 => chapter 5 manny cursed under his breath as he opened the door of his snow covered car to get out . 
7157 => some snow from the roof of the car fell down his neck as he exited the car . 
7158 => son of a manny cursed under his breath , trying to extract the cold wet snow with his hand , but simply pushing it farther down his back . 
7159 => he stepped out of the car onto the icy parking lot and his feet started to slide out from under him when he tried to stand . 
7160 => he grabbed the door of the car to keep from falling . 
7161 => after he stabilized himself , he slammed the car door in disgust . 
7162 => he looked up into the slate gray sky . 
7163 => the snowflakes seemed to be getting bigger and more abundant . 
7164 => manny hunkered down into the large collar of his overcoat , set his sights on the coffee shop front door , and set out . 
7165 => it was a combination duck walk and town drunk shuffle he used to get to the door on the treacherous surface . 
7166 => once inside the door , manny looked around , spotting the person he was there to meet . 
7167 => amanda , nice to see you , thanks for coming down on this lovely day , manny said as he turned his head to indicate outside , a contemptuous look on his face . 
7168 => hows it feel , not deciding peoples fates anymore , he asked as he struggled out of his coat . 
7169 => kind of boring , but lucky for you because ive thrown the book at guys that looked as bad as you did getting to the door . 
7170 => but judge , my only crime is not having claws , manny laughed . 
7171 => me neither , amanda returned the laugh , i never minded winter as long as i was busy , but now im not so sure . 
7172 => im moving as soon as i tie up the last of the loose ends . 
7173 => im going to try a different climate . 
7174 => no kidding ? 
7175 => is that for my benefit ? 
7176 => i mean the rub to make me jealous ? 
7177 => manny turned to look out the window and sighed . 
7178 => i cant believe its been snowing for six days straight . 
7179 => manny , its minnesota , and its november , what else would you expect ? 
7180 => you sound like cassey , except she loves this shit . 
7181 => i used to too , but since im retired my thinking has changed . 
7182 => im going to try the tropical life style . 
7183 => big switch , but what if youre jaded to incredibly decent weather ? 
7184 => i can always come back . 
7185 => where you going , if you dont mind me asking ? 
7186 => i think ill try the grand caymans . 
7187 => really ? 
7188 => retired judge slinks off to her secret tax haven , huh ? 
7189 => is this something i should pass on , or keep to myself ? 
7190 => manny looked at amanda with a smirk . 
7191 => think itll make the locals jealous ? 
7192 => damn right . 
7193 => i know i am . 
7194 => good , i had to listen to all their sad songs for too long . 
7195 => i did my thing , now let everyone wonder . 
7196 => atta girl ! 
7197 => so manny , you sounded official over the phone . 
7198 => whats on your mind ? 
7199 => billy palmer . 
7200 => amanda contoured her lips and crinkled her brow , her eyes getting serious . 
7201 => she still had the expressional face , that timeless professional attractiveness . 
7202 => she could go from incredibly compassionate and mother-like to stone cold dangerous , just from the change in her face , as many found out when they stood in her court looking up at her . 
7203 => billys trial was only my third one so i was pretty new . 
7204 => carl andrews kind of tied my hands on that one . 
7205 => he didnt give me any reasons to go soft on palmer . 
7206 => i did what i thought i was being paid for . 
7207 => you seem culpable about that now ? 
7208 => ive always felt bad about the decision i had to make , but like i said my hands were tied . 
7209 => i almost went to the funeral . 
7210 => what stopped you ? 
7211 => i didnt figure it would do anything for billy and just make me feel bad . 
7212 => what is it you want to know about him ? 
7213 => he wasnt guilty , manny stated . 
7214 => so i found out later . 
7215 => how come you didnt step forward at the time ? 
7216 => i was selfish . 
7217 => cassey was my thing then , and it worked to my advantage . 
7218 => thats a big confession ; not many people would be willing to expose themselves so blatantly . 
7219 => it may sound noble , but admitting it just makes me feel worse , manny confessed . 
7220 => when did you realize billy wasnt guilty ? 
7221 => i wasnt certain until years later . 
7222 => i found out long after it was too late to do anything about it . 
7223 => then why the guilty feelings about your decision at the time ? 
7224 => you always question yourself when you can put somebody away . 
7225 => its a hell of a power they give you , and billy had no criminal record before that , except some cannon thing . 
7226 => manny laughed . 
7227 => i never really found out what it was about , amanda continued , and he was never in any trouble after that . 
7228 => when you sentence somebody , its kind of a justification to see them again . 
7229 => you know , reinforcement because i was right about so and so the first time because here they are again . 
7230 => i never saw billy again , and never heard a bad thing about him after that either . 
7231 => gets you wondering . 
7232 => didnt you wonder about the lousy defense he got ? 
7233 => oh sure , i wouldnt hire carl andrews to represent my goldfish , but in carls defense , he realized that and got out of criminal law . 
7234 => what made you give billy the sentence you did ? 
7235 => the prosecutor was very good . 
7236 => he convinced me billy was guilty . 
7237 => but was it fair , bringing vietnam up , accusing him of being dangerous because of his war experiences ? 
7238 => that had nothing to do with my decision . 
7239 => i sentenced billy because i thought the jury was right , that billy had assaulted bueler and i didnt realize the truth at the time . 
7240 => you said you found the truth later , how ? 
7241 => marsha dent . 
7242 => she got in a little trouble later and confessed to me , hoping to get my sympathy . 
7243 => she was always in trouble . 
7244 => she probably still is . 
7245 => i got the impression she had an interest in billy and he snubbed her . 
7246 => anything to that ? 
7247 => i suppose so , but she threw herself at any available guy . 
7248 => i know billy never had any interest in her . 
7249 => so you think thats why she never came forward ? 
7250 => hard to say , but she wasnt the only one that kept quiet . 
7251 => amanda looked at manny , waiting to see what he had to say . 
7252 => i already confessed ! 
7253 => manny said throwing his hands up defensively . 
7254 => so you did , so you did . 
7255 => so bills vietnam thing had nothing to do with it ? 
7256 => id like to think so . 
7257 => anyway thats what i tell myself , but dammit , we were all sick of that bloody war and i guess a little guilty we got pulled in and lost so much . 
7258 => but like i said , that prosecutor was sharp and i didnt know it at the time , politically hungry . 
7259 => he was looking to his future and that trial was his spring board . 
7260 => you know they call him senator now . 
7261 => i know , i called him , but he wont talk to me . 
7262 => does that surprise you ? 
7263 => no , nobody wants to take the blame . 
7264 => what blame ? 
7265 => look , i can appreciate what youre trying to do ; right a terrible wrong . 
7266 => maybe it needs to be done and i applaud you . 
7267 => manny , people hate to be held accountable for things they did in the past , especially if they appeared to be right at the time . 
7268 => christ we could all be permanently crippled by our guilt . 
7269 => why are you so determined ? 
7270 => so it doesnt happen again . 
7271 => oh , you have a son in the service , am i right ? 
7272 => yeah , donny , great kid . 
7273 => cassey and i went to kentucky to see him last summer and met many of his fellow soldiers . 
7274 => hard to believe , but a quarter of them were girls . 
7275 => one was absolutely gorgeous . 
7276 => i would have never figured that . 
7277 => i mean , heres a heart stopper and shes running around in fatigues , playing soldier . 
7278 => i asked donny how the guys treated her and he said , real careful , if you didnt want your eyes gouged out . 
7279 => none of the guys could figure out how to put the hustle on her because she was so serious about the soldier thing . 
7280 => ill tell you , donny and his friends are sharp , dedicated soldiers . 
7281 => i dont want to see them abandoned if things get tough . 
7282 => those boys in vietnam saw to that , manny . 
7283 => we never thanked them because we didnt appreciate their sacrifice until much later , but we will always remember . 
7284 => we know now that we can not afford to throw away our fine young men and women . 
7285 => theres a great big wall in washington that sees to that . 
7286 => you know , our esteemed senator fights every day for the troops . 
7287 => do you think he remembers how he helped destroy one ? 
7288 => maybe thats the reason he fights so hard for them now . 
7289 => i sent a copy of the trial transcript to his office , i wonder if hell read it . 
7290 => im not too sure how happy that will make him . 
7291 => if big black cars start appearing in your life , youll know he wasnt tickled about being reminded . 
7292 => did he ever find out the truth ; that billy wasnt guilty ? 
7293 => i brought it up one time , after i knew . 
7294 => and ? 
7295 => and politicians have extremely thick hides . 
7296 => when i mentioned the cannon incident , you laughed , amanda said . 
7297 => i was away at school so i never did hear the real story . 
7298 => you know anything about it ? 
7299 => oh , hell yeah , i was there . 
7300 => we were in our mad bomber stage , making bombs , cannons , that sort of thing , blowing stuff up . 
7301 => andys next door neighbor , bruce littles dad , had that machine shop and billy and bruce got one of the guys at the shop to bore out a cannon so it would fire a big ass ball bearing . 
7302 => they did all this without bruces dad knowing . 
7303 => this guy that worked in the shop bought us beer because we fixed him up with gma , get more ass , a girl we went to school with . 
7304 => bruce blackmailed him into making the cannon . 
7305 => bruce and andy brought the cannon to bruces house , since his parents were away , and they made a wooden mount for it . 
7306 => billys going , guys , this is not a residential thing . 
7307 => this is not good . 
7308 => lets take it out in the country , or something , etc . 
7309 => billy wasnt too keen on firing it in town . 
7310 => andy couldnt get the car because his sister was hogging it , and they wanted to shoot this thing off , really bad . 
7311 => so they put this monstrosity in the middle of bruces back yard , poured a shit pot of black powder down the barrel , stuffed rags in , rolled the ball bearing in , rammed everything tight and pointed it at the garden shed next to the fence . 
7312 => we stacked plywood left over from a porch remodel , stored behind the shed , to fire the ball bearing into . 
7313 => we had four of these thick plywood sheets stacked next to each other . 
7314 => andy , bruce , and i were all go on this thing , but billy was still talking no . 
7315 => anyway , we light the fuse and run like hell around the side of the house , and it goes off . 
7316 => kaaaboooomm ! 
7317 => it shook the house . 
7318 => it shook houses for blocks around , busted nine windows total . 
7319 => we look around the house and the backyard is full of black smoke , i mean obscured , and the cannons gone , ripped right off the mount . 
7320 => it put a huge divot in bruces backyard and knocked down a whole section of fence . 
7321 => andy is freaking out because he knows his mother is still home , and hes just got off being grounded for some other shit . 
7322 => billy and i go running to see how far the ball bearing went into the plywood . 
7323 => we pull one sheet after the other until they are all laying there with big ass , ragged holes through all of them . 
7324 => theres a big hole in the side of the garden shed . 
7325 => we look inside the shed , and the mower in there has no handles , just two stubs , and the shed has a hole out the other side . 
7326 => we run out of the shed , and there is a big hole in the fence . 
7327 => andy by this time has run home and bruce is hiding , i dont know where , so that leaves billy and me . 
7328 => billy crawls between the shed and the fence and looks through the hole , and yells out , uh oh , its someplace inside andys house . 
7329 => we figure its time for us to go too and we get the hell out of there . 
7330 => the cannon ball stopped in the back of the sofa in andys living room . 
7331 => andys mother just happened to be sitting on the sofa and got a bruised hip . 
7332 => andy deigned any connection to the affair , bruce was toast cause all the evidence was there in his back yard , but the asshole that built it went to bat for the bosss son and the whole thing landed squarely on billy . 
7333 => it was the talk of the town for weeks . 
7334 => he was lucky andys mother wasnt hurt bad , and everyone was sort of laughing about it . 
7335 => so , it wasnt too serious in every ones head , but it cost billy a pretty good chunk of change . 
7336 => he had to pay for everything . 
7337 => he worked that whole damn summer , just to pay it off you got away with everything ? 
7338 => amanda asked . 
7339 => at the time my parents were real strict , billys werent , so he took the blame . 
7340 => besides , he was the one that built it . 
7341 => i was clean except for going along with andy and bruce . 
7342 => i did pay for all the beer that billy drank that summer though . 
7343 => chapter 6 manny was back in carl andrews office , standing over the desk . 
7344 => he had declined the offer to sit down . 
7345 => you dumb ass , the prosecutor made him admit to shooting at people and you never cleared the air . 
7346 => they were n't people , god damn-it , he was shooting at the enemy . 
7347 => why didnt you bring that up ? 
7348 => i didnt think it was relevant . 
7349 => how can you call yourself an attorney ? 
7350 => you let him hang , dip shit ! 
7351 => he got himself into it ! 
7352 => and dont you come here talking to me like that ! 
7353 => i will not stand for it ! 
7354 => you hear me ! 
7355 => they were all lying , carl ! 
7356 => you talked to marsha , she was there and she told you bueler started it . 
7357 => so dont bother trying to protect your integrity . 
7358 => not with me , not now ! 
7359 => what about you manny ? 
7360 => you knew what happened , and you didnt say anything . 
7361 => i was not hired to defend him and i certainly didnt take an oath to protect him . 
7362 => that would be you , carl . 
7363 => it was no big deal , the judge only gave him six months . 
7364 => for something he didnt do . 
7365 => if he was so tough , he should have handled it . 
7366 => you know , life doesnt always hand us a dream world . 
7367 => no , not all of us , thats for sure . 
7368 => you and i got handed one though , and billy palmer , he got handed shit . 
7369 => gee , life sure sucks . 
7370 => why are you doing this after all these years ? 
7371 => you werent his biggest fan either , if i remember correctly . 
7372 => no , no i wasnt , and im damned ashamed of it now . 
7373 => now we all trip over our dicks to salute our heroes , but we were damn quick to deny them even the slightest respect then . 
7374 => they were different , our men and women are much better now . 
7375 => oh , really ! 
7376 => if as you say ; the youth was all screwed up then , that includes all of us . 
7377 => you and i included , bozo . 
7378 => but that does make sense , considering the job you did for billy ! 
7379 => look manny , darnit , i didnt do the best job i could have , but i was young , and to tell you the truth i was never cut out for the court room . 
7380 => i didnt hate billy . 
7381 => he was a vet back from that horrible place , and we were so inundated with negative propaganda . 
7382 => i dont need to explain or defend my opinion regarding the time . 
7383 => i think vastly different about what happened in vietnam these days . 
7384 => do you know , ive gone to the wall three times . 
7385 => ive walked the paths up and down that horrible place more than once . 
7386 => ive stopped and read the names , many of the names , and believe me , it makes you think . 
7387 => i thought of billy every time i was there . 
7388 => you ever been there manny ? 
7389 => no , ive been in washington , but never go look at all the names , cut in carl , and then we can discuss this again , fair enough ? 
7390 => and manny , sometimes i think about being tied up on casseys porch . 
7391 => i kind of chuckle to myself and wish it could have been you . 
7392 => * manny decided to call ed wyscouski , the resident bully he had discussed with cassey . 
7393 => wyscouski had played golf with billy after they had returned from the service . 
7394 => back then wyscouski had been learning the game and billy was helping him . 
7395 => hey ed , manny anderson . 
7396 => manny , how the hell you doing ? 
7397 => i imagine it must be getting good and miserable , about now ? 
7398 => you got it , manny replied . 
7399 => ed wyscouski had not spent a winter in red pine in years . 
7400 => so , whats on your mind ? 
7401 => going to take me up on the offer to spend some time down here this winter ? 
7402 => i might just do that ed , but the reason i called is ; i just attended billy palmers funeral . 
7403 => wyscouski was quiet for a moment . 
7404 => damn , i hadnt heard . 
7405 => im sorry to hear that . 
7406 => he was a good guy and then he just disappeared . 
7407 => what the heck happened to him ? 
7408 => i dont know , thats what im trying to find out ? 
7409 => now ? 
7410 => its a little late manny my friend , and dont go blaming vietnam , palmer came back just fine . 
7411 => i know , i know , but i just cant get it out of my mind that we might have been a little responsible . 
7412 => oh , dont let it get you down , manny , of course you were responsible . 
7413 => you were just too immature , then . 
7414 => too immature to appreciate the tough , necessary job someone else was taking care of for you . 
7415 => thanks wyscouski , is that supposed to help me feel better ? 
7416 => manny , you dont want to feel better . 
7417 => if you did , you wouldnt have called . 
7418 => manny , what youre concerned about has been happening forever and always will . 
7419 => its called a guilt trip . 
7420 => i know that , but but what ? 
7421 => wyscouski interrupted . 
7422 => get off your dead ass , find out what billy was all about , and then you can feel better about yourself . 
7423 => let me know what you find . 
7424 => * manny and cassey were sitting together , cuddling and watching the fireplace crackle and pop . 
7425 => you didnt tell me what happened with carl today . 
7426 => oh , i went tearing in there , told him off good . 
7427 => and ? 
7428 => and , he pulled some lawyer shit on me . 
7429 => really sherlock , thats what they get paid for , you know . 
7430 => yeah , he nailed me good , made me look bad . 
7431 => you want to meet me in washington ? 
7432 => to do what ? 
7433 => i want to go see the vietnam memorial . 
7434 => what brought that on ? 
7435 => weve been there a couple of times , and you never andrews stuck it to me . 
7436 => i made a big spiel about his duty to billy , and he asked me if i had ever been to the wall . 
7437 => turns out he has , more than once , and i get the feeling he shed a tear or two , and now i need to go . 
7438 => i thought you were headed to new york to see the publisher buddy of billys ? 
7439 => on the way back , ill just be stopping in d 
7440 => c 
7441 => for the day . 
7442 => well , ill pass , you dont want me sobbing at some dreary monument . 
7443 => you know how i get , but thanks for asking . 
7444 => chapter 7 thank you for seeing me mark , manny said , shaking hands with mark tainer , billys ex-partner . 
7445 => it appears that you are a very busy man , so i wont take up much of your time . 
7446 => no problem , manny . 
7447 => mark pointed to a big chair off to the side of his desk . 
7448 => i can always take some time out to chat about old and dear friends . 
7449 => it was a shock to hear that billy palmer was gone . 
7450 => bill and i were very close , we went through some interesting times together . 
7451 => we operated as a two man team , back then ; where our very existence depended on our actions coordinating . 
7452 => when was the last time you talked to billy ? 
7453 => oh boy , let me think ? 
7454 => damn , it must be twenty-five years now . 
7455 => he came to see me just after i got married . 
7456 => you didnt stay in touch ? 
7457 => well , manny , i have a confession to make . 
7458 => my first wife was not too pleased to have an old marine buddy show up . 
7459 => she was very demanding and any attention that went somewhere else was not appreciated by her highness . 
7460 => billy was very uncomfortable , and i was very much in love , so the reunion wasnt a big success . 
7461 => i stayed married to that particular lady for twelve years and by the time i got clear , billy was long lost , im afraid . 
7462 => yeah , i can understand , manny returned . 
7463 => i was really close to billy once , and a woman came between us too . 
7464 => but , in all honesty , tainer quickly returned , after i got back to civilian life it wasnt so important anymore . 
7465 => in the marines we were close out of a need for the moment , tainer confessed . 
7466 => can you tell me what it was like , what billy was like to serve with ? 
7467 => manny asked . 
7468 => yes , i probably could , but first you should understand why we did what we did . 
7469 => there are many misconceptions about vietnam . 
7470 => the truth was never an issue that was explored in any depth . 
7471 => there have always been two great questions : one , why we got involved in the first place , and two , why couldnt we win ? 
7472 => mark sat , waiting for a response from manny . 
7473 => i dont know ? 
7474 => its kind of why im here , manny said , filling in the gap . 
7475 => i knew so little about it , but i was warned to stay out of it by the very guy im trying to find out about . 
7476 => palmer told you to stay out of it huh ? 
7477 => what exactly did he tell you ? 
7478 => that it was a bunch of shit , a load of crap , and that i didnt have what it would take to stay alive . 
7479 => of course , he told everyone that . 
7480 => he said we would make terrible soldiers because thirteen months was no way to run a war . 
7481 => if you got sent over there , all you had to do was make the thirteen months and then you could go home . 
7482 => as soon as you get there , you started counting the days . 
7483 => the only motivation is to survive , not seek out and destroy the enemy . 
7484 => yes , its a hell of a penalty when the other side is following different rules . 
7485 => they stay until the job is done , or they die . 
7486 => were you offended by billy telling you all this ? 
7487 => mark returned . 
7488 => at the time , i guess a little . 
7489 => some of the other guys were pissed off , but looking back , they probably wanted to hear that . 
7490 => i can remember them showing body bags on tv . 
7491 => christ thats all you saw night after night , the same old shit . 
7492 => i know , i didnt want to go after seeing that a few times . 
7493 => all billy really ever told me about the war ; was that it was his first , definitive reality check when he was looking at body bags that were his friends . 
7494 => he realized he was going in one direction and they were going in another . 
7495 => know anybody that was killed ? 
7496 => mark asked yeah , a couple of guys from the next town over bought it . 
7497 => what did you think of that ? 
7498 => it scared the shit out of me . 
7499 => and you saw it continually , on tv ? 
7500 => every night . 
7501 => yeah , the media was definitely out of control . 
7502 => the first mission billy and i got was riding shotgun for this french journalist . 
7503 => man was she ugly . 
7504 => she would run right up front when the shit hit the fan , trying to get the pulitzer picture . 
7505 => shed stick her camera right in the faces of the wounded . 
7506 => a real heartless bitch . 
7507 => she finally got shot in the ass on the fourth day . 
7508 => the media was there to line their own nests , but it wasnt the reason we apparently lost , mark said seriously , sitting forward in his chair , resting his elbows on the edge of the desk . 
7509 => the main reasons we apparently lost that battle , he continued , was one , we were compromised in the field . 
7510 => every operation , every move we made was relayed to our allies , the south vietnamese . 
7511 => the war was supposed to be a joint cooperation with the arvin , the south vietnamese army and they were full of viet cong . 
7512 => second , politics , and the likes of you helped loose the war manny . 
7513 => you and the politicians because any democracy will have trouble defeating any enemy that does not directly threaten the home front . 
7514 => unless the enemy is marching down main street there will be some politician or political advocate that will be looking for an issue to rally support , to either get votes or to shirk responsibility . 
7515 => why does that include me ? 
7516 => manny asked , curious . 
7517 => because ; billy warned you that it was not in your best interest , so you didnt support the effort ! 
7518 => tainer criticized . 
7519 => and the other side realized that if they just held out , eventually that lack of support would turn in their favor . 
7520 => you know manny , a bunch of hayseeds with a half-baked , personal agenda can cancel out any worthwhile endeavor . 
7521 => there was nothing worthwhile about vietnam , manny declared . 
7522 => oh really , tainer said , annoyed . 
7523 => any communists running around , pointing missiles in our direction these days ? 
7524 => well , yeah , china manny started to list the countries , but tainer cut him off . 
7525 => all headed toward capitalistic societies , tainer said . 
7526 => they want to be like us because we broke the soviet union by standing up to their military expansion . 
7527 => vietnam is now one of the fastest growing economies in the world because we gave them the taste of freedom and prosperity . 
7528 => we may have lost the battle , but we did win the war . 
7529 => there should be a better way than stomping on people to get their attention , manny commented . 
7530 => not so far , not in our barbaric world , tainer said . 
7531 => you said we were compromised in the field , and no one did anything about it ? 
7532 => manny asked . 
7533 => it was so despicable the government still wont talk about it , let alone admit anything , and they knew the whole time . 
7534 => they had this program , something thought up , by i cant imagine who , called cheiu hoi , open arms . 
7535 => we paid any viet cong eighty-five dollars a month to come on over to our side . 
7536 => at that time their national average income was about two hundred and fifty dollars a year . 
7537 => well , come over they did , but the powers that be didnt exactly screen those guys . 
7538 => they came over all right , but all we got were vc agents . 
7539 => of course when it became evident that the whole thing was a failure , nobody wanted to admit the mistake , so the easiest thing to do was deny there was anything wrong . 
7540 => come on tainer , how could they be so stupid ? 
7541 => you want to hear stupid ? 
7542 => a society that still had one foot in the stone age was able to completely humiliate the most advanced technological society to date , and get paid while doing it . 
7543 => thats beyond stupid , its ludicrous , but fact . 
7544 => too much money was flowing and no one was willing to stand up and say enough , lets fix it . 
7545 => in a capitalistic society anyone that rocks the boat when things are humming will meet a stone wall . 
7546 => so , even though we were being sold out , it continued because no one wanted to take the blame , or stop the money , manny commented . 
7547 => yup , when we were there in 66 , our sniper teams controlled an area between con tien and the rock pile , an area in northwest vietnam . 
7548 => we acted with impunity in that area . 
7549 => the teams controlled an area 30 miles long and 20 miles deep , right up to the river to north vietnam and the laotian border . 
7550 => just on the other side of the boarder was the ho chi min trail . 
7551 => boy , that was something up there , once you got into stalking the prey , the hunting and the kill , its hard to back away . 
7552 => i dont know if i could to this day if i was presented with the opportunity . 
7553 => anyway , marine force recon operated beyond us , right into laos and north vietnam . 
7554 => they used to come back pissed off as hell . 
7555 => they would find troop concentrations , camps , truck parks , all kinds of nva convoys and supply depots , then they would call in air strikes and sit and watch the target empty before the strike would take place . 
7556 => it would take sometimes two days until the strike would occur and by then the bombs would find nothing but empty jungle to wreak . 
7557 => we had a policy of working with our allies and by god , the powers that be , regardless of the outcome stuck to their policy . 
7558 => didnt anyone figure out what was going on ? 
7559 => of course everyone knew what was happening , but squawking about it didnt do any good . 
7560 => shit , the guys that saw it happening were told that how the war was run was none of their business . 
7561 => they were putting their lives on the line and being betrayed by their own commanders and everybody knew it . 
7562 => my god , i never realized it was that bad , that our government could be so inept ? 
7563 => manny , youre a business man , what makes a business fail ? 
7564 => you run out of money . 
7565 => and if the money never stops flowing ? 
7566 => i guess you dont need to be too bright , if thats the case . 
7567 => its the first rule of politics , money talks . 
7568 => thats how we ended up in vietnam , in the first place . 
7569 => vietnam had a long history of being invaded and repelling those that transgressed on her turf . 
7570 => the big question was why did the u.s 
7571 => attempt to conqueror an enemy with such a stellar record ? 
7572 => well , its simple , the u.s 
7573 => never thought about winning any war there . 
7574 => they had just bought fifty-five hundred huey helicopters from bell , located in texas , lbjs home turf by the way . 
7575 => the u.s 
7576 => military needed a combat situation to test the new fast attack principle made possible by the introduction of the huey . 
7577 => the huey was light , powerful , and easy to manufacture , and there was plenty of money to run the test . 
7578 => the military was blinded by the desire to modernize and forgot the main reason they should have been there , to win what they started . 
7579 => by the time they had gotten the data they needed to understand the principle of helicopter warfare , they were caught in a situation they needed to get out of , but couldnt . 
7580 => i guess thats what billy was trying to tell us when he got back , manny said . 
7581 => he hated the war , called it criminal . 
7582 => he got so angry about the things being said about the soldiers being screw-ups . 
7583 => he put all the blame on the politicians , but he never explained it like you just did . 
7584 => many people used that against him , said that he was defending the problem , defending baby killers , that sort of thing . 
7585 => i can remember him saying , let me see if i can remember this right . 
7586 => he told me that quote , politics is a system devised by those that cant , to reap the benefits earned by those that can . 
7587 => bingo ! 
7588 => tainer laughed . 
7589 => youll never find a politician that knows the meaning of oops . 
7590 => that was palmer all right , mark continued . 
7591 => he was a smart dude . 
7592 => he had a feel for the war , knew what was going on . 
7593 => everyone in our outfit looked up to him , and everyone wanted to go into the field with billy . 
7594 => he had a reputation for finding the action and living to tell about it . 
7595 => he never said much about it after he was back , manny commented . 
7596 => what did you expect him to say ? 
7597 => i dont know , but not telling any stories led people to think that he wasnt really in combat , that he was over there fucking off , or something . 
7598 => oh manny , i dont know if you ever figured it out or not , but guys that spend to much energy telling pussy or war stories are generally full of shit . 
7599 => yeah , i figured that out , eventually . 
7600 => i kind of figured billy had been in the thick of it , and i think most other people suspected it too , but theres always the ones that cant tally anything . 
7601 => billy had gotten wounded and there was a rumor that he had lost his arm or hand , but when he came back home he was all in one piece , so the rumors started flying . 
7602 => he wouldnt say anything , so no one got the truth . 
7603 => im curious about something you said ? 
7604 => manny continued . 
7605 => you said you guys controlled this area . 
7606 => how can that be ? 
7607 => id always heard that the countryside belonged to the vc . 
7608 => oh bullshit ! 
7609 => the viet cong and nva planned everything in detail , from an ambush to an attack . 
7610 => if you hit them unexpectedly they didnt know what to do , and besides , they were afraid of the jungle . 
7611 => the whole population of that country , north and south , lived next to the jungle , but they only went in fifty feet to relieve themselves and then right back out to the trail , village , or paddy . 
7612 => as children they never played in the jungle , out back in the woods , like we did . 
7613 => we never saw any villagers in there , not like the american soldier . 
7614 => shit , as kids we all played in the woods , hunting and fishing , exploring , cowboys and indians , even playing soldier for christ sakes . 
7615 => and how many of us got our first piece of ass out in the woods . 
7616 => its good prep , believe me . 
7617 => wasnt the jungle different ? 
7618 => i mean nastier than back home ? 
7619 => where you from , minnesota , didnt you say ? 
7620 => yeah , red pine minnesota . 
7621 => any woods around ? 
7622 => oh , hell yeah , mostly woods , some very thick stuff too . 
7623 => you can get really lost if you arent careful . 
7624 => hunters get lost all the time , some of them die walking around in circles . 
7625 => you could get eaten to death by the mosquitoes . 
7626 => spend any time in there ? 
7627 => hell yes , did a lot of hunting . 
7628 => and , yeah , got laid too . 
7629 => get any good figuring out how to find your way around ? 
7630 => tainer asked . 
7631 => oh yeah ! 
7632 => not as good as billy though , everyone kind of followed his lead . 
7633 => that was billys forte , map reading , tainer explained . 
7634 => he had this skill of always knowing exactly where he was and where to go , at all times . 
7635 => when we got to going out with the line companies , the officers relied on him almost exclusively . 
7636 => i remember one time a platoon commander was arguing with his co about our position . 
7637 => this lt 
7638 => was certain we were in this particular village and billy disagreed . 
7639 => the co went with billy and sure enough he was right . 
7640 => they were calling in artillery and you didnt want to be in the wrong spot when it hit . 
7641 => i remember that , billy was real savvy about the woods . 
7642 => manny said , shaking his head in agreement . 
7643 => same as vietnam . 
7644 => like i said , the enemy had no experience in that shit , so it gave us a big advantage . 
7645 => yeah , still , wasnt the jungle a lot more dangerous ? 
7646 => we didnt have poison snakes in our neck off the woods . 
7647 => tainer laughed . 
7648 => hell , i grew up in magnolia , arkansas , woods just as bad as any jungle , swamps , bogs , quick sand , water moccasins , rattlesnakes , you name it . 
7649 => most of that shit is nothing more than an uncomfortable annoyance if you know what youre doing . 
7650 => you know what billy liked about the vietnam jungle , as opposed to minnesota ? 
7651 => tainer asked , waiting for manny to answer . 
7652 => manny just shrugged . 
7653 => you brought it up , mosquitoes , tainer continued . 
7654 => he said that the bugs were nothing compared to back home . 
7655 => the jungle is a lot quieter to move around in too , not as much dry material , everything is damp and soft . 
7656 => we could slither through that shit without making a sound . 
7657 => wed sometimes see how close we could get to the little buggers , just for the hell of it . 
7658 => slip right up to them and then back out . 
7659 => we even snatched a kid one night . 
7660 => some damn kid soldier , about twelve , went out in the woods to take a dump and walked right up to us . 
7661 => he dropped his pants about a foot from me and i just reached out and grabbed him , one hand over his mouth and that was it . 
7662 => poor kid had walked for three months from the north , up around hanoi . 
7663 => he had an ak47 , three magazines , and a sock of rice . 
7664 => the poor bastard was convinced we were going to eat him , anyway thats what he was told . 
7665 => i sure hated to turn him over to the arvin bastards , knowing what theyd do to him , but that was the policy . 
7666 => theyd torture the hell out of their own people , just to make it look good . 
7667 => make us think that they really hated the viet cong , when they were cong themselves . 
7668 => crazy shit huh ? 
7669 => tainer said shaking his head in disgust . 
7670 => i remember one time after we moved down south , tainer continued , we were based southwest of da nang . 
7671 => the base camp was surrounded by villages and rice paddies and we couldnt operate like we did in the north , so we went out with the companies . 
7672 => that was a fuckin mess . 
7673 => a hundred idiots walking down the trails and across the paddies in full view , yelling , cursing . 
7674 => now , that scared the shit out of me . 
7675 => anyway , sometimes some asshole company commander would try and mess with us , try to make us walk point , stand watches , some stupid shit that we didnt like , so wed grab a villager and call in a chopper . 
7676 => we were in charge of prisoners , captured gear , so forth and were supposed to escort any prisoners to the arvin compound in da nang . 
7677 => we grabbed a couple of villagers one day , a man and a woman , after some stupid shit and figured wed spend a couple days in da nang , see some movies , drink a little beer , whatever . 
7678 => anyway , an arvin chopper picks us up with these two villagers and were up there at five thousand feet , and this arvin major is interrogating these villagers . 
7679 => trying anyway , i mean shit all weve got is a couple rice farmers , grabbed out of a fuckin paddy while theyre working away . 
7680 => so this major is getting nothing but toy comb beick , i dont know , and he gets pissed , and grabs the woman , and throws her out of the chopper . 
7681 => i couldnt believe it ! 
7682 => i thought billy was going to kill this son-of-a-bitch . 
7683 => billy had his hands around the majors neck , holding him about a foot off the chopper floor , choking the shit out of him , the little bastards legs kicking away . 
7684 => i had to pop billy in the back of the head with my rifle butt , to get him to stop . 
7685 => jesus , what happened then ? 
7686 => not much , the major was sitting on the floor gagging , his sidekick pointing out the door screaming , vc , vc . 
7687 => they werent about to mess with billy because he had this nasty look on his face . 
7688 => i was worried that billy was going to shoot somebody , really . 
7689 => im sure they were thinking the same thing . 
7690 => when the chopper landed , they were in a real big hurry to get rid of us . 
7691 => yeah , i remember billy getting mad , manny added . 
7692 => it was rare , but when he did , watch out . 
7693 => i remember playing hockey . 
7694 => billy was tough , that was one place you didnt want to mess with him . 
7695 => one time i hit him with a high stick and he warned me . 
7696 => i did it again , i hit him in the nose , and i was sure sorry i didnt take him serious . 
7697 => he zeroed in on me for the rest of the game and made my life miserable . 
7698 => i ended up crawling into a snow bank and laying there for half an hour after the game was over . 
7699 => so you guys took the war serious , huh ? 
7700 => manny continued . 
7701 => ill bet you two were good ? 
7702 => oh yeah , shit wed catch those buggers , sometime as many as a hundred , pop off a couple shots , then move and they never came after us . 
7703 => like i told you , they didnt know what to do because we surprised them . 
7704 => i remember billy and i followed a couple squads of nva , north vietnamese army , porters for three days , picking them off , slowly but surely , and they never tried to come and get us . 
7705 => the only reason we backed off was they moved into an area of rice paddies , and we lost our cover . 
7706 => i can almost visualize that , i remember billy was a good shot , manny said . 
7707 => actually , billy didnt like to shoot that much , tainer commented , after he nailed an old lady with a chair . 
7708 => one day we saw two people in black pajamas diddy bopping down a trail across a paddy about 500 meters away . 
7709 => one of them had something sticking up from a pack on their back . 
7710 => looked like a rifle from that distance . 
7711 => turned out to be a chair that had been taken apart . 
7712 => not a good scene . 
7713 => anyway , after that billy tended to run the show instead , spotter , decision maker , etc . 
7714 => he was very astute and cautious . 
7715 => after the chair thing , he was especially careful to make sure that we were taking shots at the proper people . 
7716 => you talk the same as billy , manny said . 
7717 => i notice that you dont like to use gook or other derogatory slang to describe the other side . 
7718 => it wasnt their fault , they were jacked into a bunch of bullshit , just like we were . 
7719 => at least we had some idea of what was going on . 
7720 => they were mostly uneducated and continually brainwashed . 
7721 => at least we only had to go through that shit in boot camp . 
7722 => once you got to vietnam , it was every man for himself , and like i said before , you learned to loath your side more , knowing what you did . 
7723 => do you think that many of those arvin you talked about , eventually got here , to the states i mean ? 
7724 => asked manny . 
7725 => oh , id imagine a lot of them did . 
7726 => they were the smart ones , looking out for themselves . 
7727 => i dont blame them either . 
7728 => i figure that if theyre lucky enough , they can come here and then do the best they can , more power to them . 
7729 => tainer looked at manny for a moment , then asked . 
7730 => so what happened to palmer ? 
7731 => whats got you so interested in us old sniper dudes ? 
7732 => oh , the more i find out about you guys , the madder i get at myself , manny answered . 
7733 => youre pissed about something ? 
7734 => tainer questioned . 
7735 => you mentioned that a woman came between you guys . 
7736 => what did you do to palmer that youre regretting now ? 
7737 => a lot of things i guess . 
7738 => billy and i were great friends since we were in grade school . 
7739 => he was a great kid . 
7740 => we had a lot of fun , i can remember so many things now . 
7741 => what happened ? 
7742 => he went to vietnam , i stayed home . 
7743 => how come ? 
7744 => oh , billy took off right out of high school . 
7745 => we were at a party one night and there was a life magazine with a pictorial about the war . 
7746 => a bunch of us were looking at it and billy made some comment about it looked interesting , or something like that . 
7747 => anyway , somebody , i cant remember who , called him on the comment and billy said , oh yeah and next thing we know , hes volunteered for the draft . 
7748 => it was only two years that way and billy said he had no interest in staying in the military any longer than he had to . 
7749 => after he passed his physical , they said he could have his choice of the army , or the marines because he had volunteered . 
7750 => i remember him laughing about how it was february and army boot camp was in fort leonard wood , missouri , and the marine boot camp was in san diego . 
7751 => he made his choice based on the weather alone . 
7752 => he said he was standing on yellow footprints , at attention , with some nasty little bastard yelling in his face , before he realized he should have thought it through better . 
7753 => that was a shock all right , mark laughed . 
7754 => i was right there with him . 
7755 => we went through boot camp and then the vietnam thing together . 
7756 => i can remember billy getting into all kinds of trouble for laughing . 
7757 => this little di would stand right in front of him staring up , giving him a line of shit . 
7758 => i mean this little guy was really tough , but funnier than hell . 
7759 => hed pick on billy , until billy would smirk or something , and then palmer would end up doing squat thrusts . 
7760 => i think that di got a kick out of palmer . 
7761 => the day we graduated that di put his hand on billys shoulder and told him to be careful and pay attention , that the war was no joke . 
7762 => how did you guys end up snipers ? 
7763 => manny asked . 
7764 => when we got over there , they were looking at our records and we both scored high on the rifle range and they asked us if we were interested in going to sniper school . 
7765 => one of the marines advised us that the regular ground pounders was not the way to go and we took it . 
7766 => i cant tell you how many times i was grateful that we did what we did . 
7767 => i felt sorry for those regular grunts , man they had it rough . 
7768 => they were tired , dirty , scared , humping all day , then digging in , standing watch half the night . 
7769 => it all adds up to being numb , thats the only way to continue . 
7770 => it went on day after day and there was nothing they could do about it . 
7771 => it could be a booby trap , a couple of shots by a sniper , a mortar round thrown in , but its all the same . 
7772 => a chopper comes and does its thing , takes somebody away . 
7773 => sometimes its someone you know , sometimes not . 
7774 => worst is when youre close to someone . 
7775 => getting close only takes a couple of hours because the guys talk about what they miss the most , whats dear to them . 
7776 => you want to hear about anybodys home , the world , as we called it , and it doesnt matter whos version you get . 
7777 => it is where you want to be instead of where you are . 
7778 => thats about as close as you can get to someone in a short time . 
7779 => sometimes it can happen two , three , four times in a single day . 
7780 => tainer continued , sadness in his vice . 
7781 => it all happens so fast , a body bag laying there was minutes ago some guy you were just talking to . 
7782 => its strange , but your heart doesnt ache for that guy , but for the family back in the states that you know is going to get some shitty news in the next few hours . 
7783 => thats where your thoughts go . 
7784 => to them because they had nothing to do with this , but theyre going to pay . 
7785 => the more they loved that guy , the worse its going to be . 
7786 => tainer paused , looked out the window , and then continued . 
7787 => i hated it when we had to go with the line companies . 
7788 => i mean talk about stupid shit . 
7789 => when we were in the jungle , just a couple of us , or maybe four or five sometimes , it was so much better . 
7790 => i would think it would be dangerous , just a small number of guys ? 
7791 => manny commented . 
7792 => no , like i told you , we moved without them knowing where we were , or if we were there at all . 
7793 => shit , we were so good that we snuck up on a tiger one time . 
7794 => no shit ! 
7795 => no shit ! 
7796 => sucker jumped about five feet straight up in the air , turned and vanished . 
7797 => i doubt if that cat had ever seen humans in the bush before . 
7798 => really surprised his ass ! 
7799 => tainer looked at manny . 
7800 => now that ive told you about billy and vietnam , you tell me why youre here ? 
7801 => i told you billy died last month , manny answered . 
7802 => yeah , and ? 
7803 => he didnt have it so good after vietnam , manny said sadly . 
7804 => many of the guys had it rough , not just billy . 
7805 => i know a few guys that never fit in after they were back . 
7806 => theyre still out there , wondering around , unstable as hell . 
7807 => the war was their only chance to shine and theyd do it again , in a flash . 
7808 => many of them came from small towns just like billy , and the military was their only cosmopolitan experience . 
7809 => after the service , they went back to the small town , and the training they got wasnt exactly something they could use to assimilate . 
7810 => makes sense , i could see where that could happen , manny agreed . 
7811 => you know some of these guys , keep in touch ? 
7812 => i know theyre out there . 
7813 => you have something you want to get off your chest ? 
7814 => tainer asked . 
7815 => how did you know that ? 
7816 => im a smart guy , thats how i got through the war without a scratch , i might add . 
7817 => billy was wounded , manny said . 
7818 => yeah , more than once . 
7819 => how did it happen ? 
7820 => you tell me whats on your mind first , and ill decide if youre worth any more of my time , mark tainer answered . 
7821 => fair enough . 
7822 => chapter 8 billy and i were friends since seventh grade , manny explained . 
7823 => he moved from someplace on the east coast that summer , the one between seventh and eighth grades . 
7824 => i met him at the golf course , he was a good player and so was i . 
7825 => the golf course was a hangout , most of my friends parents belonged , like mine did . 
7826 => billys didnt , but he hung around there to caddie . 
7827 => he was a good player and the golf pro let him play . 
7828 => we pretty much lived at the course in the summer because they also had a swimming pool and tennis courts . 
7829 => everyone liked billy because he was fun . 
7830 => the girls liked him too because he was nice to them , kind of like a brother , or a confidant . 
7831 => billy was sort of daring , not beyond pulling stunts . 
7832 => if you were looking for something to do , he was the guy . 
7833 => he was sort of a loner too . 
7834 => i mean , you couldnt talk him into doing anything he didnt want to do and he didnt push himself on you , but the good stuff just seemed to happen around billy . 
7835 => i mean , i could sit here for hours and tell you about some funny stuff . 
7836 => he could screw around in school and most of the time the teachers would get a laugh out of it . 
7837 => he never did something that got anybody else in trouble , and if any trouble came our way , he would cop to it , even if he wasnt the one , and it would blow over . 
7838 => oh , he wasnt an angel or anything like that because there were somethings that we could have gotten into real trouble over , but we were lucky , i guess . 
7839 => one of our big things was throwing snow balls at cars and it got a little out of control . 
7840 => they had this husband and wife golf tourney every summer , kind of crazy golf , and they had this big sling-shot to fire the golf balls on one hole . 
7841 => we got a hold of it and used it to fire ice balls at cars because it would shoot a whole block . 
7842 => we pummeled the three cop cars in town one night for about half an hour from the back of a nursery . 
7843 => one of the cops got pissed and started shooting his pistol at us , so we scrammed . 
7844 => we saved the slingshot and put it back , so the cops never figured it out . 
7845 => there was this hood , thats what we called the tough guys then , wyscouski , and he used to beat everyone up . 
7846 => we set a trap for him one night . 
7847 => we hit wyscouskis car with snow balls and when he got out , billy let wyscouski see him so he would chase him . 
7848 => billy drew him into this back yard with a high fence and we were all waiting . 
7849 => man , did we knock the shit out of wacko , that was his nick name . 
7850 => anyway , he tried to run out the other side gate , but we had iced down the sidewalk and stretched a blackened rope across the open gate and wyscouski caught it right in the running lights . 
7851 => we thought we had killed him , knocked him out cold . 
7852 => billy and i carried him across the street and put him on billys girlfriends porch and rang the doorbell . 
7853 => he never figured out who it was until years later . 
7854 => he would have killed us then , im sure . 
7855 => he suspected billy , but i think he kind of liked billy , cause he never did anything to him . 
7856 => we used to work together and billy was kind of over me . 
7857 => it wasnt official , or anything , but he was just more dependable than i was , and better with the customers . 
7858 => the boss , old man mcpherson , knew it and kind of took advantage of billy because billy would take care of anything that came up and the old man counted on it . 
7859 => he never gave billy anything extra , but he used to compliment him a lot . 
7860 => pump sunshine up my skirt , as billy used to say . 
7861 => billy used to cover for me and andy mcpherson , the bosss son . 
7862 => andy was a real fuck-up , but his dad let him get away with a lot and billy picked up the slack , so andy didnt look so bad . 
7863 => i can remember one time i got billy fired . 
7864 => it was all my fault . 
7865 => we were working saturday and i came in late . 
7866 => i had , had a rough night . 
7867 => manny sat thinking , reflecting back . 
7868 => geez manny , you stink ! 
7869 => how much you drink last night ? 
7870 => billy asked me when i got in . 
7871 => i told him , way too much man and i feel like shit . 
7872 => i dont know if i can do this . 
7873 => oh my head ! 
7874 => shit , advised billy , were the only two this morning , youve got to stick it out , i told him i didnt know if i could , that throwing up on customers was a real possibility . 
7875 => billy laughed and said , well dont barf on somebody important . 
7876 => old man mcpherson will fire us both . 
7877 => hes already pissed . 
7878 => i wanted to know if mcpherson had been in yet and billy said , yeah , hes down at the diner getting breakfast . 
7879 => billy covered for me and told the old man i was having car trouble , but was on my way . 
7880 => billy told me , itll blow over , just dont figure on going home until hes gone for the day . 
7881 => i was so sick , i was wondering if i was green or anything ? 
7882 => no , billy said , but you smell like a friggin brewery , so just stay in back , ill take care of out front . 
7883 => okay , but if i get any sicker , i told him , i dont know what will happen ? 
7884 => no problemo , billy told me , but youre going to have to stay close , going home right now is not an option . 
7885 => anyway , i gargled with some mouthwash and when old man mcpherson came back , i guess i passed all right because he just gave me a sort of snitty look , but didnt say anything . 
7886 => he went off to play golf about noon and i went and laid down in the back room and fell asleep for a while . 
7887 => andy came in , he was supposed to work the afternoon shift , but he had been drinking already to kill the hangover he had . 
7888 => billy was supposed to get off at two , but andy was in no shape to relieve him and i was still feeling bad so billy said he would close up for us and we took off . 
7889 => that stupid andy forgot to throw his beer cans away and old man mcpherson came back just after closing and found them . 
7890 => billy had everything finished and was going home and i had come back to make it look like i had been there all day . 
7891 => i brought a couple beers and billy and i were going to share one . 
7892 => mcpherson came storming out into the parking lot , and theres billy with the beer . 
7893 => he hadnt even taken a drink . 
7894 => mcpherson fired him on the spot and didnt say a word to me until billy left , then mcpherson asked me if i knew that billy was drinking on the job and i said i wasnt sure , but i didnt think so . 
7895 => billy had to beg for his job back . 
7896 => thats when the old man accused him of stealing . 
7897 => there was always money missing , not much , but i guess enough for the old man to notice . 
7898 => we knew it was andy all along , but we never ratted on him . 
7899 => mcpherson made billy work for two weeks for nothing , otherwise he wouldnt give him his job back . 
7900 => red pine was a small town and that job was about the only one that was decent , so billy didnt have any choice . 
7901 => he put up with a lot , especially andy and i screwing around all the time . 
7902 => while billy was away in vietnam , mcpherson built a brand new store , about five times bigger ; a real full service operation . 
7903 => when billy got back , it was by far the best job within fifty miles . 
7904 => billy came back to work , but while he was gone , i was made assistant manager in charge of the sporting goods and andy had taken over the hardware dept . 
7905 => billy ended up working for us and we werent very nice to him . 
7906 => i mean , looking back , we were still kind of fuck ups , not as bad as high school , but andy was still skimming a few bucks and i didnt work as hard as i could have . 
7907 => im finding out now that in the two years billy was gone ; he matured and did incredible things , while we just enjoyed life . 
7908 => the worst thing that happened to billy , manny continued , was the tri-town golf tournament . 
7909 => after billy quit working at the store because he got tired of our bullshit so he went to work at the golf course . 
7910 => he worked on the maintenance crew and the course superintendent loved him . 
7911 => he started working in the spring and worked on his golf game all that summer . 
7912 => i dont think he had played for a couple of years because of the marines , but he got his game back fast and was playing really well and on labor day week , there is a tri-town tourney . 
7913 => billy , andy mcpherson and i were in the championship flight . 
7914 => i had won my second match , and was to play the winner of the match between billy and andy . 
7915 => andy was the crowd favorite , but i didnt think he had a chance . 
7916 => i knew i could beat andy , but didnt think i could beat billy , so i was pulling for andy too . 
7917 => the whole town was at that tourney , watching that match and we were such snobs , no one even offered to caddie for billy . 
7918 => andy was pulling the match out of his butt because he chipped in three times and sunk two long putts and they came to the eighteenth even . 
7919 => andy hit a bad drive into the rough on the left side and billy hit a great shot up the right , into this open spot just in the rough . 
7920 => from there it was an easy shot to the green . 
7921 => one of andys friends was standing right where billys ball stopped and he picked it up and put it in his pocket . 
7922 => it was just this little group of andys friends standing there when billy came up to find his ball . 
7923 => no one copped to what had happened and billy had to take a two shot penalty for a lost ball and lost the match right there . 
7924 => i found out what happened a little later , but i didnt say anything because billy had already left the course . 
7925 => billy left town about a week later , and no one saw him again for , oh i dont know , probably twenty years . 
7926 => i guess he came back once , just to look around . 
7927 => manny turned away , quiet for a moment . 
7928 => he got thrown in jail because of us . 
7929 => manny told mark the story , admitting to the whole thing . 
7930 => he also showed mark the trial transcript . 
7931 => that son-of-a-bitch had the balls to do this ? 
7932 => mark raised his voice , holding the transcript up to manny , shaking it . 
7933 => pretty sad , huh ? 
7934 => it gets even worse . 
7935 => cassey miller was his girlfriend . 
7936 => cassey and billy had been together since freshman in high school . 
7937 => she was really beautiful , intelligent , and kind . 
7938 => i was a little jealous , but andy , bueler and some of the other guys were really infatuated with her . 
7939 => while billy was in vietnam , we used to bring up the baby killing and all that . 
7940 => anything we could to make the soldiers look bad , to make her forget billy . 
7941 => i dont know what worked , but after billy had been gone for about three months , just after he got wounded the first time , cassey started hanging around me and i was thrilled . 
7942 => i was floating on top of the world and i started dreading billy coming back because i thought it would be over with cassey . 
7943 => we got close and a couple of months before billy came home , we were lovers , and cassey just stuck with me . 
7944 => i was terrified that she would dump me and go back to billy , but he didnt seem all that upset when he found out , and cassey figured that he didnt care about her enough , so i ended up with the girl . 
7945 => were you proud of yourself ? 
7946 => hell no ! 
7947 => look , i dont know how i felt . 
7948 => i was scared shitless though . 
7949 => andy mcpherson said billy was just waiting for the right time to cut my throat , to get cassey back . 
7950 => what made you think you were worth his time ? 
7951 => oh , after a while i stopped worrying , but when youre in love its really important to you at the time . 
7952 => so for a little fling , you stabbed your best friend in the back . 
7953 => look , i know what youre thinking , but in my defense cassey came to me first and she is a wonderful lady . 
7954 => im still married to her today . 
7955 => well , that is a touching story . 
7956 => how does this cassey feel about what youre doing ? 
7957 => well , like she told me , she became a good wife and mother . 
7958 => according to her it was her duty , ergo , no fault of hers what happened to billy , but she sympathizes and supports my mission . 
7959 => your mission , is that some kind of attempt to impress me , the military talk ? 
7960 => oh no , geez , im sorry . 
7961 => i wasnt trying to be a smart-ass . 
7962 => i dont know why i said that . 
7963 => i guess it does feels like a mission though , trying to find out what made billys life fail . 
7964 => well , fuckin duh ! 
7965 => you take a guys integrity , something he earned the hard way and deny him the respect he deserved and you wonder why his life gets screwed up . 
7966 => you get him put in jail on a trumped up charge and then you wonder how he failed himself . 
7967 => do you have any idea how it must have felt for him to be incarcerated , especially wrongfully ? 
7968 => you come whining to me , wondering , what happened to him ? 
7969 => you and your worthless friends are what happened to him ! 
7970 => what a bunch of assholes you people were . 
7971 => it must have been great to be so privileged . 
7972 => do you know what we all learned in vietnam ? 
7973 => we learned team work , sticking together . 
7974 => we had to , to stay alive . 
7975 => then billy comes home and his friends are jealous and they work against him and they get away with it . 
7976 => does that answer your question ; what happened to billy palmer ? 
7977 => he performed brilliantly under the worst of situations . 
7978 => he proved himself as a leader and then he had to deal with you smucks . 
7979 => can you imagine how he must have felt , trapped , having to take orders from you clowns ? 
7980 => i manny started to make an excuse , but mark cut him off . 
7981 => no , i dont imagine you could . 
7982 => now you come crawling to me for absolution . 
7983 => geez , im so sorry about what i did , i didnt know . 
7984 => bullshit mr 
7985 => anderson , youre here to make yourself feel good ! 
7986 => you dont give a shit about billy , never did . 
7987 => youre not sophisticated enough for that . 
7988 => you dont have to look him in the face and apologize , do you ? 
7989 => no , hes not around anymore . 
7990 => the best you can do is stand over his grave and say , geez im reeeaaaally sorry , that we were dumb fucks , but we just didnt understand . 
7991 => why dont you make sure your pretty wife is there too ? 
7992 => so she can tell billy she is also sorry , sorry that she ended up with your sorry ass , instead of a real man . 
7993 => you know what a hero is , do you sport ? 
7994 => its someone that does what no one else has the guts to . 
7995 => its someone that takes the responsibility for everyone else and doesnt expect anything in return . 
7996 => i guess i deserve that , manny said , his head down . 
7997 => damn right you do ! 
7998 => mark said , staring intently at manny , but , its too late for an appeal , and all the tears in the world will make no difference . 
7999 => you expected to come here , spill your guts , shed a few tears for effect , and then have me absolve your guilt . 
8000 => but , i will not do that because it is way beyond my capabilities . 
8001 => you are a selfish man , mr 
8002 => anderson , you always were and always will be . 
8003 => what do you really want from me ? 
8004 => i dont know ! 
8005 => manny shouted , throwing his hands up . 
8006 => he turned around , walked to the window , looking out frustrated . 
8007 => i keep thinking im doing this for my son donny , hes in the army now , air cavalry , but i dont know ? 
8008 => donny , smonny , tainer scolded , youre bored with life and billy palmer and his story excite you . 
8009 => the more you find out , the more you want to know . 
8010 => is that wrong ? 
8011 => am i such a horrible man ? 
8012 => see , youre just typical . 
8013 => again it goes back to you ! 
8014 => youre only worried about what i think of you . 
8015 => i guess i do ? 
8016 => why ? 
8017 => because i respect you , manny said , looking around the office . 
8018 => that my friend , is a load of crap ! 
8019 => i saw you looking around , judging me by what ive got . 
8020 => do you respect the man ive become , or do you respect how i got here ? 
8021 => then again , maybe none of the above . 
8022 => you might just be jealous , just like you were with billy . 
8023 => it has nothing to do with how i got here , nothing at all to do with who i am . 
8024 => you made the same mistake with palmer . 
8025 => manny , the turmoil is in your head . 
8026 => was it a mistake ; the way you judged billy , or is it how you really are ? 
8027 => you tell me , youre the expert on recognizing and appointing guilt . 
8028 => look manny , im not jumping your ass because i think youre an especially terrible person . 
8029 => tainer said calmly . 
8030 => we are a fucked up species , and i think you are just starting to realize why . 
8031 => i rather doubt that . 
8032 => the more i think i know , the more i realize just how stupid i am . 
8033 => there , now youre finally getting somewhere . 
8034 => ill tell you a little secret , let you off the hook a little . 
8035 => we are simply a product of our emotions , all of us . 
8036 => we have created this unbelievable technology , machines even doing our thinking for us and what happens ? 
8037 => our most important decisions are based on how we feel at the time . 
8038 => were just another dumb animal , governed by fear , jealousy , envy , sadness , happiness , all the same motivation my dog lives by , all just instincts . 
8039 => we can claim were above all that , that were superior , just deny it , but in the end , theyre the driving force in our lives . 
8040 => can i say something , something that will undoubtedly piss you off ? 
8041 => manny asked . 
8042 => go right ahead . 
8043 => of course youre right about almost everything . 
8044 => ive felt and acted exactly as you say . 
8045 => i dont appreciate the harshness you presented it with , but ive matured enough to accept a little criticism now and then . 
8046 => but , regardless of what my reasons are now , and i dont really know myself , id hoped that you being so close to billy you would have the decency of at least helping me in my quest . 
8047 => billy was forgotten , and maybe i can do something to rectify that . 
8048 => i cant do anything about the past , but i can sure do something about the future , and my sons well-being is important to me , as well as the little woman . 
8049 => god-damn manny , i was wondering if you were going to stand up to the shit-beating or not ? 
8050 => what , you figured id walk out the door because you hurt my feelings ? 
8051 => i was hoping not , but most people would have . 
8052 => and ? 
8053 => you would have gotten nothing further from me . 
8054 => how the hell did you get so mean ? 
8055 => mean , in my business you have to yank on peoples chains to get the best out of them . 
8056 => if you coddle them , they think youre accepting their lousy work and figure they dont have to do anything more . 
8057 => i raise hell with them so they try , and try , and try to appease me . 
8058 => you wouldnt believe how that can get the creative juices flowing . 
8059 => i think billy was trying to write a book . 
8060 => was he now ? 
8061 => id like to see that because he had a complex mind . 
8062 => a vietnam book ? 
8063 => boy , you know , i couldnt say . 
8064 => how did you know he was writing ? 
8065 => he approached me and a couple of the guys about buying into what he was working on . 
8066 => what did you think of his work ? 
8067 => i dont know , i never read it . 
8068 => one of the guys was in advertising and he said it was ridiculous to buy into a book , said it was a silly way to invest . 
8069 => that so ? 
8070 => some big money in the story business . 
8071 => for some reason people like to be entertained , and they even pay , go figure huh ? 
8072 => id like to see whatever you can find , maybe he had something . 
8073 => and manny , have you ever been to the wall in washington ? 
8074 => no , thats where im headed now . 
8075 => got some names here , mark reached for a pad and wrote down a list of names , then handed it to manny . 
8076 => itll be interesting to see what your first impression might be . 
8077 => and manny , what youre missing , why youre trying so hard to understand is you have never been tested , so you dont know how youll react under pressure . 
8078 => we all wonder , you know , and only a few of us ever get put in a situation to find out . 
8079 => thats the little thing that separates the warrior from the rest . 
8080 => chapter 9 i cant believe im doing this , manny mumbled , sitting in the back seat of a washington d.c 
8081 => cab , looking out the window . 
8082 => all he can see of the city is mostly obscured by heavy falling snow . 
8083 => it is not a good day to go sightseeing , i do agree with you sir , the cab driver replied in a heavy middle-eastern-accent . 
8084 => oh , i wouldnt be stupid enough to go sightseeing on a day like this , manny said , thinking of defending his appearance as a rational american . 
8085 => this is more of a request , no , more like an order . 
8086 => some person makes you to go to that strange wall . 
8087 => strange , why would you say that ? 
8088 => manny was more curious than annoyed by the comment . 
8089 => in this great country of america , you pay such a small price for so much . 
8090 => in my country everybody is in war , and a wall like that would be to honor those that lived , not those that were lost . 
8091 => welcome to america , manny said cynically . 
8092 => yes , it is great place , especially on day like this . 
8093 => in my country , getting warm on day like this would be very difficult . 
8094 => manny guessed that explained why it was blazing hot in the cab , the driver luxuriating in it . 
8095 => manny was certain deodorant and soap where also in short supply in this mans homeland . 
8096 => he was almost relieved when the cabbie announced that they had arrived at a good spot for him to walk to the memorial . 
8097 => the snow was coming down even heavier , but the temperature was not as cold as he was used to in red pine , and there was no wind . 
8098 => huge flakes fell straight down out of the slate gray sky . 
8099 => * manny started toward the wall , taking the direction the cab driver had indicated . 
8100 => the snow , six inches deep , covered everything and he had no idea if he was on a path or not . 
8101 => manny walked through some trees and came to a small slope . 
8102 => down below he could make out a long black ribbon rising out of the snow . 
8103 => he walked down the slope and moved abreast of the monument , the full wall appearing out of the gloom . 
8104 => he noted its sloping shape , the highest part meeting in the middle to his right . 
8105 => he was standing where the stone began , only six inches high , then rose gradually to the center where it was ten feet tall . 
8106 => he turned to face the wall , stooped down and saw names etched deep into the black stone . 
8107 => he looked to his left , toward the middle , noting that the number of names increased as the stone got taller . 
8108 => geez , you dumb ass , manny said to himself . 
8109 => you dont even know how the names are arranged . 
8110 => manny looked around hoping to spot someone , but it looked like he was absolutely alone . 
8111 => had to pick a time when there was no one around to help , didnt ya , manny said to himself as he continued down the wall , just looking over the names as it grew in height , not really reading them . 
8112 => he had a list of five names that tainer had given him , five guys that billy had known , now nothing more than a name and a memory on this wet , black obelisk . 
8113 => he had walked almost the entire length of the wall , passing the middle , then down the other side until he had gotten to where the wall was low again . 
8114 => he glanced up a path leading away from the monument , saw a concrete pedestal and headed for it . 
8115 => on the pedestal was a book under a plexiglas cover with names followed by towns and cities listed . 
8116 => he lifted the cover , conscious of the snow falling on the pages , but he suspected that the book was always maintained , so he looked for the names on his list . 
8117 => the book also explained the order of the names . 
8118 => they were on the wall chronologically , from the time of death . 
8119 => the killing spree started at the center , the highest part of the monument and moved down the slope to the right , to the bottom of that wing and then flipped way over to the left wing , continuing at the bottom , moving up , ending at the center , the junction that formed the two angles of the stone wall . 
8120 => manny found all the names in the book which was in alphabetical order . 
8121 => after each name the location on the wall was listed . 
8122 => all the names he sought were on panel eleven , lines eight through fourteen . 
8123 => manny walked back down to the wall and found the eleventh panel and then the names . 
8124 => he looked to his left and a short distance away , no more than ten feet , was the joint in the wall . 
8125 => there , eleven panels away , the first casualties of the vietnam war were listed . 
8126 => his eyes moved from panel one , back over panel eleven , just skimming , estimating the numbers by the amount of space they took up . 
8127 => his eyes passed panel eleven and then continued down toward the end of the wall as it tapering off to nothing , sliding out of existence into the snow . 
8128 => he was thinking back to what billy had told him ; about the war being a bunch of crap , not worth the lives they were losing . 
8129 => that it was being fought all wrong because our leaders werent even trying to win , etc . 
8130 => mark tainers words came to him as he stepped back a few paces and looked to his left , where the other wing of the wall appeared out of the snow and gradually rose to the middle to meet the right wing , the one with panel eleven on it , the whole time one thought kept going through mannys mind . 
8131 => those fuckers ! 
8132 => he exclaimed out loud . 
8133 => they knew it here , manny pointed to eleven , straight in front of where he stood , and did nothing about it as all these guys , manny moved his hand down the wall , to the right , stepping back as he went . 
8134 => he got to the end of the right side and turned back the other way quickly , sticking out his left hand to point to the far start of the wall , moving it quickly back to the center . 
8135 => died for nothing ! 
8136 => he shouted at the top of his lungs , swinging his arm past his body , twisting around one hundred and eighty degrees until he was facing away from the wall . 
8137 => manny stood there , looking straight ahead , the snow falling on his bare head . 
8138 => off in the distance he could see a figure watching him . 
8139 => it looked like a woman , but it was hard to tell . 
8140 => he stood looking at the person , wanting whoever it might be to come the rest of the way so he could tell someone , anyone , what he had discovered . 
8141 => it dawned on him that everyone that came to this place with a name , probably went away with the same feeling of disgust that was coursing through his body . 
8142 => whoever designed this sure did their job , huh ? 
8143 => manny shouted to the person watching him through the falling snow . 
8144 => there was no response , so manny turned , looked at the wall one more time and walked away . 
8145 => as he was ascending the slight slope , he turned as he walked and saw the unknown person now descending toward the memorial . 
8146 => probably thinks im some deranged sob . 
8147 => cant blame them a bit , manny said quietly , the snow soaking up the sound of his voice . 
8148 => * manny stood in the deepening snow at the edge of the street , slowly shaking his head deep in thought , as a cab came driving up the street . 
8149 => manny was so lost in his thoughts he didnt perceive the cab pulling up to him . 
8150 => sensing he was not alone he looked up and then it registered ; it was the same cab . 
8151 => his first thought was to let this one go , he wasnt cold , just numb from the experience , but the driver sat there , waiting for him to decide . 
8152 => the passenger window of the cab slid down and the driver leaned over . 
8153 => you might be only business for the day , sir , the cabby said quietly . 
8154 => oh , im sorry , i was just thinking . 
8155 => you saw the name of a loved one there ? 
8156 => manny hesitated , loved one ? 
8157 => billys name wasnt there , but what was billy to him ? 
8158 => i guess i had loved billy once , but certainly not when it counted . 
8159 => i saw some names that told me more about myself than i care to admit , manny confessed , reaching for the door handle . 
8160 => that black stone is very powerful , sir . 
8161 => i have seen many come back as you have . 
8162 => is that why you waited for me ? 
8163 => it is a slow day , sir . 
8164 => manny didnt say anything as he got in the car , but he knew the driver was sensitive to what the meaning of the wall was and how it affected people . 
8165 => did they treat soldiers in your country bad like that ? 
8166 => manny asked as he gestured back with his head , back toward the park . 
8167 => much worse , sir , much worse . 
8168 => i see america as a place that learns her lessons . 
8169 => sir that is why i am here . 
8170 => thank you very much . 
8171 => i learned a lot today . 
8172 => i appreciate you looking out for me . 
8173 => it is just my job , sir . 
8174 => chapter 10 manny anderson , havent seen you in a long time , gwen , billys sister said , holding open the door to her house . 
8175 => come on in , i was surprised when tom said you had called and wanted to come down here . 
8176 => ill bet its cold as hell back in red pine . 
8177 => i miss the seasons , but not the cold , she said as she walked into the kitchen . 
8178 => ill never regret moving to san antonio . 
8179 => its a lot nicer here this time of the year , for sure , manny replied , seeing gwens husband tom sitting at the table . 
8180 => yeah , we like it , gwen continued . 
8181 => it can get a little hot in the summer , but everything is air conditioned , so we make it okay . 
8182 => its a little strange at christmas , but with all the kids gone , what the heck . 
8183 => how the heck you doing tom ? 
8184 => its good to see you again , manny said as he shook toms hand and then took an empty chair at the table . 
8185 => not bad manny , tom returned . 
8186 => i didnt expect you to get here so soon though , but its good to see you . 
8187 => hell , its got to be twenty years since gwen and i were back up there . 
8188 => how are things for you back in the land of killer mosquitoes ? 
8189 => not bad , winters too long and too hard , same old stuff . 
8190 => hows your golf game these days ? 
8191 => tom asked . 
8192 => i hardly play anymore , backs not too good . 
8193 => not bad , actually , im still playing to a two , but one of these years i will have to accept the inevitable . 
8194 => so , what does bring you to texas , manny ? 
8195 => gwen asked . 
8196 => i understand that billy left some stuff with you ? 
8197 => anyway , thats what tom told me . 
8198 => yeah , he was trying to write a book , gwen said without any excitement . 
8199 => i heard about that , manny responded . 
8200 => he asked me one time if i could help him try to get it published . 
8201 => that was some time ago though , and i kind of blew him off . 
8202 => yeah , a long time ago , gwen returned . 
8203 => it was just a lot of gibberish . 
8204 => i read some of it , and it was a waste of time , too many mistakes . 
8205 => oh come on gwen , there was some good stuff in there , tom countered . 
8206 => oh tom , those vietnam vets were a pain in the ass , all of them . 
8207 => expected everyone to have sympathy on them , because they served , gwen snarled . 
8208 => gwen , billy never bothered you for anything , tom scolded her . 
8209 => youre just bitter because of campbell , because he put you through a lot . 
8210 => a lot ! 
8211 => gwen cried . 
8212 => i wasted ten years of my life on that bum . 
8213 => boy was he screwed up . 
8214 => nothing but a drunk and a druggy , and ill tell you , he wasnt that way before he went over there , guaranteed . 
8215 => that war really fucked him up . 
8216 => the war didnt screw him up , tom returned . 
8217 => hell , he didnt ever go out in the field . 
8218 => i know for a fact ; he spent his whole time in the rear killing his brain cells , doing drugs . 
8219 => billy was no better , he didnt do anything with his life , did he ? 
8220 => gwen sneered . 
8221 => well , you and your family sure didnt make it easy for him , tom said i cant believe youre trying to blame gwen said defensively . 
8222 => folks please ! 
8223 => manny interrupted . 
8224 => i didnt come here to try to focus any blame . 
8225 => i just would like to see the things he wrote . 
8226 => can i see the stuff youve got ? 
8227 => i guess . 
8228 => ill go look for it , gwen said leaving the room . 
8229 => dont tell her i told you , tom whispered , but she borrowed some money from billy and was supposed to edit that writing for him , but never got around to it . 
8230 => i read quite a bit of it and ive got to tell you , i thought some of it was damn good . 
8231 => theres one story i really liked . 
8232 => about vietnam ? 
8233 => manny questioned . 
8234 => no , no , there was nothing about the war . 
8235 => fiction stories , and like i said some of it was interesting . 
8236 => i feel sad about old billy , he wasnt a bad guy at all . 
8237 => he never caused us any trouble , but it was just that gwen went through so much shit with campbell . 
8238 => she really tried to make that marriage work . 
8239 => she just couldnt accept that the problem was campbell himself , and just blamed the war . 
8240 => in her head everyone involved in that fiasco was lumped into the same boat . 
8241 => you had a brother that was there , didnt you ? 
8242 => manny asked tom . 
8243 => yeah , stan . 
8244 => he came back okay ? 
8245 => oh yeah , hes a great guy . 
8246 => shit , a hell of a lot more normal than most people i know . 
8247 => you know billy came through here one time . 
8248 => he was looking for work and i wanted to hire him , but gwen raised hell , so to keep the peace i didnt go through with it . 
8249 => billy knew he wasnt wanted and left the next day , tom said . 
8250 => im finding out that a lot of people looked the other way when it came to him , manny returned . 
8251 => i wonder why , it didnt make sense to me ? 
8252 => tom said . 
8253 => the jail thing , and then he was gone for a long time . 
8254 => manny kind of shrugged . 
8255 => when he did come back , he didnt have anything , so people just assumed he had gone bad . 
8256 => yeah , i can still see billy getting off that bus here in san antonio , a tiny , little bag in his hand . 
8257 => he looked so sad . 
8258 => something bad had happened , i could tell , but i couldnt get it out of him ? 
8259 => i never did understand how he got in all that trouble years before . 
8260 => i never heard of him hurting anyone , except that idiot bueler . 
8261 => old billy was always funnier than hell and so easy going . 
8262 => we all lied about that tom , and i was as much to blame as anyone . 
8263 => jesus manny ! 
8264 => i know , i look back , and i am not proud of myself . 
8265 => talk about looking back ? 
8266 => it was strange , his family didnt care much about him , and ill never understand that . 
8267 => you know , his dad was a fairly good guy , but he had this thing about billy . 
8268 => i never could figure out why ? 
8269 => lots of gwens opinion is based on that . 
8270 => billys mother went with the old man too . 
8271 => * gwen came back with a box filled with papers . 
8272 => manny picked some out and looked through what he had in his hand . 
8273 => boy , theres a lot of writing here . 
8274 => its nothing but junk , i tell yeah , gwen said . 
8275 => do you mind if i take this , ill bring it back ? 
8276 => manny asked . 
8277 => nah , keep it , i have no use for it , gwen said . 
8278 => i guess im wondering why you didnt attend the funeral ? 
8279 => manny asked . 
8280 => many people there ? 
8281 => gwen countered . 
8282 => no , just cassey and i 
8283 => cassey , cassey miller ? 
8284 => gwen returned . 
8285 => yes . 
8286 => you two got married , right ? 
8287 => gwen said , accusingly . 
8288 => yeah . 
8289 => still ? 
8290 => still married ? 
8291 => yes . 
8292 => the two of you , his ex-best friend and his ex-girlfriend . 
8293 => how romantic , gwen said with the accusing tone . 
8294 => at least we went ! 
8295 => manny exclaimed , a little angrily . 
8296 => i had three days notice , and in case you cant figure it out , gwen returned , also angry , it was a long way to go . 
8297 => i dont know what you do for money , but tom and i have to watch what we spend ? 
8298 => very pragmatic of you , manny stated . 
8299 => billy was very pragmatic , as im sure you knew . 
8300 => gwen stood glaring at manny . 
8301 => do you think he would have approved ? 
8302 => manny hesitated , not wanting to continue the argument . 
8303 => yes , he would have understood , he said quietly . 
8304 => look , manny , i appreciate your going to my brothers funeral , but we just werent a close family , gwen said calmly with a sad voice . 
8305 => i hadnt seen him in years . 
8306 => what the hell difference would it have made to billy , if i was there or not ? 
8307 => not much that i can see , manny said , shaking his head . 
8308 => dont get prissy with me ! 
8309 => gwen shouted . 
8310 => you guys were always together when you were kids , and then after he comes back , nothing . 
8311 => i heard all the stuff about you and that tramp cassey going out behind billys back . 
8312 => great home coming he had . 
8313 => comes home and his girlfriend is shacking up with his best friend . 
8314 => i guess you couldnt be friends anymore , huh ? 
8315 => gee , i wonder why ? 
8316 => sounds like you needed to be at the funeral more than i did . 
8317 => im just trying to manny hesitated . 
8318 => trying to what ? 
8319 => you know manny , whats done is done , and i appreciate what you think youre trying to do . 
8320 => it may sound noble , but just admit youre doing it for yourself , so dont try to bullshit me , okay . 
8321 => and tell cassey , i said thanks for going to the funeral . 
8322 => gwen spun on her heels and walked away . 
8323 => * tom saw manny out to the car . 
8324 => look manny , between you and i , im sorry about billy . 
8325 => like i already said , he was an okay guy , but you know how convoluted family dynamics can be and when the fix is in , it just is . 
8326 => yeah , its just that after its too late , where do you go to get it right in your own head ? 
8327 => manny asked , shaking toms hand . 
8328 => chapter 11 manny was sitting at his desk in his office , staring out the window . 
8329 => the phone rang and he picked it up . 
8330 => manny , cassey said on the other end , ive been sorting through that writing you gave me , that stuff you got from billys sister . 
8331 => how come you never read any of this ? 
8332 => didnt you say billy came to you about it ? 
8333 => not me directly , he talked to frank nesbit . 
8334 => billy thought that because frank was doing copyright he might know something ? 
8335 => did frank read any of this ? 
8336 => geez , i dont know ? 
8337 => frank just said that it was a waste of time . 
8338 => there was no money to be made from an unknown author . 
8339 => i think thats what he said because it was a long time ago ? 
8340 => whats up , anything good ? 
8341 => good ? 
8342 => im no expert manny , but this one story im cleaning up is really something . 
8343 => its called timtown . 
8344 => some kid called tim finds an alien base thats abandoned , but its still chewggling along . 
8345 => its run by a computer that the kid calls mr 
8346 => v , mr 
8347 => voice . 
8348 => im just a quarter of the way through , but i cant put it down . 
8349 => billy was quite the writer , manny . 
8350 => im fixing it as i go and i should have a cleaned up copy by tomorrow . 
8351 => you have got to read this . 
8352 => this story would make a hell of a movie . 
8353 => no kidding ! 
8354 => manny sat forward . 
8355 => i never figured billy to be a writer , he never did any when we were hanging around . 
8356 => well , he sure as hell figured it out somewhere along the way . 
8357 => when you getting home ? 
8358 => not too much longer , ive got a couple of things to wrap up . 
8359 => i located that guy that put billy and tainer in for the medal , and guess what ? 
8360 => oh , oh , youre happy about something . 
8361 => could it be this requires a trip to , lets say , a warm climate . 
8362 => florida babe , about as warm as it gets . 
8363 => * manny was sitting enjoying the fire he had built in their large stone fireplace . 
8364 => this is about the only thing i can really say i enjoy about winter , a good stiff drink and a roaring fire , manny said to cassey , as she walked in carrying a stack of papers . 
8365 => heres the first six chapters , good reading , cassey said , giving manny the stack of papers . 
8366 => she had a proud , accomplished look on her face . 
8367 => that was quick , you must have put some work into this ? 
8368 => not really , billy had it all pretty much together . 
8369 => i just had to figure out where , and there it all was . 
8370 => manny started reading , the clock on the fireplace mantle said 6:34 . 
8371 => * at 8:51 , manny got to the last page and put the manuscript down . 
8372 => he got up and walked into the kitchen , opening the refrigerator getting something to drink . 
8373 => he closed the refrigerator and went out of the kitchen , heading to the rear of the house . 
8374 => he walked into casseys office , next to their bedroom . 
8375 => manny stood watching cassey work at the computer , scanning pages into the machine . 
8376 => got any more ? 
8377 => manny asked . 
8378 => cassey turned part way around , still working as she spoke . 
8379 => whatd you think ? 
8380 => you didnt change anything , it was that way , the story ? 
8381 => i edited typing errors , some grammar , many spelling errors , but didnt change a thing . 
8382 => wow ! 
8383 => manny said . 
8384 => i dont know what to say . 
8385 => i mean , im no expert either , except that i like to read and i appreciate a good book , but i am truly amazed . 
8386 => billy really came up with something , huh ? 
8387 => thats what im thinking , and it gets even better . 
8388 => ive got two more chapters finished . 
8389 => all right lady ! 
8390 => manny exclaimed . 
8391 => * the clock on the mantle read 2:58 a.m , the fire was out , and manny was still sitting , reading , when cassey walked into the room , stretched and yawned . 
8392 => damn manny , you still at it ? 
8393 => me , i dont see you turning in yet ? 
8394 => im going to have to . 
8395 => i wont be able to finish it until i get at least a little sleep . 
8396 => you going in this morning ? 
8397 => i dont know , how many more chapters you got ? 
8398 => im through with chapter 26 , about ten more to go , but im getting bleary eyed . 
8399 => anymore and ill start making too many mistakes . 
8400 => pretty damn good huh ? 
8401 => fabulous story , what an imagination . 
8402 => billy sure knew how to put a story together . 
8403 => im going to send this off to mark tainer as soon as youre done . 
8404 => itll be interesting to see what a professional thinks . 
8405 => i wonder if billy ever got a copyright for this story ? 
8406 => cassey asked . 
8407 => who would own it at this point ? 
8408 => i have no idea , but i can check with slauson , our legal eagle , he should know how to find out . 
8409 => i would imagine his closest relatives . 
8410 => shit , wouldnt that be something , those buggers getting rich off billy after they treated him like that . 
8411 => chapter 12 manny was sitting in the kitchen opening up a can of dog food , the phone cradled between his chin and shoulder , waiting . 
8412 => george of the jungle , the andersons dog , was sitting patiently his tail swishing quietly on the tile floor . 
8413 => george was a bigmultinationalas manny described him to people that asked . 
8414 => hes one part afghan , one part irish wolfhound , one part german shepherd , and one part ugly , manny was fond of saying . 
8415 => best damn dog ive ever known , he would also throw in . 
8416 => george was more dedicated to cassey than manny , but that was to be expected because cassey took george with her everywhere she went . 
8417 => george of the jungle wandered into the andersons back yard , years before , a scraggly , under nourished bag of bones that couldnt have been more than a few weeks old . 
8418 => manny and cassey had no ideaat the timejust how big the dog was going to get . 
8419 => yeah , this is manny anderson for mark tainer . 
8420 => yes , i see . 
8421 => no , thats all right , just leave a note that i called and that i sent him some material , and it should be arriving in the next couple of days . 
8422 => no , its not unsolicited , he asked me to send it . 
8423 => could you put on the note that i found the material to be fascinating . 
8424 => yes , anderson , manny , no im not an author . 
8425 => yes , thank you , have a nice day . 
8426 => * manny was dialing the phone again , watching george play in the snow outside . 
8427 => it was a sunny , bright , winter wonderland out in the back yard , and george was racing around , running with his muzzle deep in the snow , looking like a big shaggy , four legged snow plow . 
8428 => shit , i hope he remembers where everything is , that could hurt if he runs into something solid . 
8429 => manny chuckled to cassey , as she walked up and looked out the window . 
8430 => oh , look , its so pretty out there , she said , looking at manny looks great from where im standing , manny agreed . 
8431 => im going skiing in a bit , want to join me ? 
8432 => nah , its good for my heart and i promised myself to avoid those things . 
8433 => you smuck , i go golfing with you . 
8434 => you like to play golf , and i dont care to work at my skiing . 
8435 => give me a big hill and ill be right there with you . 
8436 => last time we down hilled , you couldnt walk for a week , cassey chuckled . 
8437 => loved every minute of it though . 
8438 => manny looked back outside . 
8439 => thats it you big , dumb , dodo , enjoy yourself ! 
8440 => manny yelled at the dog . 
8441 => george heard him through the glass and stopped , looking at manny attentively , snow covering his muzzle , his tail wagging furiously . 
8442 => you knuckle head , you dont know any better do yeah ? 
8443 => manny shouted at the dog . 
8444 => i dont what ? 
8445 => a man asked , suddenly on the other end of the phone line . 
8446 => oh hello , manny responded . 
8447 => oh sorry , i was talking to my dog . 
8448 => dumb bugger doesnt have a care in the world , even likes playing in the snow . 
8449 => can you imagine that ? 
8450 => the snow can be fun , sometimes , i guess , the man on the other end returned . 
8451 => spoken like a man in florida , manny laughed . 
8452 => mr 
8453 => walsh , my name is manny anderson and i would like to talk to you about vietnam . 
8454 => if that would be okay ? 
8455 => ah , do i know you ? 
8456 => no , im sure you dont , but i promise , im not a reporter or anything like that . 
8457 => i ya . 
8458 => . 
8459 => .im u for marines that possibly knew a friend of mine , and your name came up . 
8460 => you were a marine lieutenant , feb 
8461 => 1967 to june 67 , 2nd battalion 5th marines ? 
8462 => yes , i was hotel company , 2nd platoon leader . 
8463 => whats this about ? 
8464 => i was wondering if you could spare me some time ? 
8465 => im interested in finding out about a buddy of mine , he served with you . 
8466 => what is his name ? 
8467 => was , i attended his funeral a couple of weeks ago . 
8468 => oh , im sorry , ah , i dont know what to say ? 
8469 => you wouldnt mind ? 
8470 => i dont see why not , what was his name ? 
8471 => would it be any trouble if i came to you , minnesota is the shits this time of the year and i need an excuse to see florida . 
8472 => i promise , this is on the up and up . 
8473 => billy palmer is the name . 
8474 => palmer ? 
8475 => walsh was quiet for a long moment . 
8476 => the name palmer doesnt ring any bells . 
8477 => im sorry . 
8478 => i hate to waste your time , its a long way to come for nothing . 
8479 => were you in the service ? 
8480 => no , but my son is . 
8481 => you wouldnt be wasting my time , really . 
8482 => do you play golf ? 
8483 => oh yeah , golf and i have a lovehate relationship going . 
8484 => ah , a comrade in arms . 
8485 => ill spring for the golf , if you dont mind ? 
8486 => i guess , come on down . 
8487 => id be happy to meet with you , but ive got to warn you i take my golf serious . 
8488 => wouldnt expect any less mr 
8489 => walsh . 
8490 => you can call me dan , seems were going to be golfing buddies . 
8491 => chapter 13 a taxi pulled up to the club drop at an expensive looking golf course , and manny opened the passengers side rear door and stepped out into the warm florida sunshine . 
8492 => manny had a big smile on his face as he breathed in the damp , warm air . 
8493 => he headed toward the rear of the cab , meeting the driver there at the trunk . 
8494 => you cant imagine how great this feels , manny said , stretching his arms out to take in the warmth of the sun . 
8495 => come from someplace cold , i take it ? 
8496 => the cabbie said friendly . 
8497 => frostbite falls , minnesota , manny replied rocky and bullwinkle ! 
8498 => i thought that was a made up place , the cab driver replied . 
8499 => it was an opportunity sorely missed , manny declared . 
8500 => youd know what i mean , if youve ever been up there in the winter . 
8501 => cutbank montana , the cabbie announced , youre not telling me anything i dont know . 
8502 => i heard thats not the end of the world , but you can see it from there . 
8503 => manny quipped , as the cab driver took the clubs out of the truck and handed them to manny . 
8504 => every time i here that , i do think of good old cutbank . 
8505 => enjoy the time you have in paradise , the driver said , as manny handed him a tip and nodded . 
8506 => an average height man dressed in golf clothes was walking toward him . 
8507 => could you be manny anderson , the famous minnesota golfer ? 
8508 => the man asked . 
8509 => that would be me . 
8510 => well , weve got a hell of a day for it . 
8511 => i hope you brought some talent . 
8512 => dan walsh , he replied as he held out his hand to shake . 
8513 => i had some before the snow banks swallowed my ball , manny returned , as they shook hands . 
8514 => im probably a little rusty , but itll come around after a few holes . 
8515 => i hope you dont mind me picking this place ? 
8516 => its a little pricey , but a damn good course . 
8517 => oh no , i was thrilled . 
8518 => ive seen this place in the golf magazines and i dont mind paying for pleasures like this , manny said excitedly , as they headed up the sidewalk , bordered with deep-green , luscious plants , topped with brilliant flowers standing three feet high . 
8519 => thank you for seeing me . 
8520 => i dont know if i can help you , it was a long time ago , and i have racked my brain and i still dont remember any palmer . 
8521 => dan walsh held the door open to let manny through into a posh , expensive looking club house . 
8522 => i guess you must be serious though , coming all this way and springing for a day here . 
8523 => im on sort of a mission , and the telephone or email just isnt any fun , not like this anyway . 
8524 => theyre convenient though . 
8525 => not all the time . 
8526 => a guy i know fell in love with a three hundred pound woman that passed herself off as quit the opposite . 
8527 => i guess face to face has some security to it , dan agreed . 
8528 => besides , what better way to spend a day ? 
8529 => manny was all smiles as they entered the pro shop . 
8530 => especially after what ive been enduring the last few weeks . 
8531 => i was sorry to hear about your friend . 
8532 => i have to admit though , its been a long time since ive really thought about vietnam . 
8533 => time does heal the worst of wounds . 
8534 => * manny and dan walsh were out on the driving range warming up for the round . 
8535 => manny was hitting , dan walsh watching . 
8536 => you play a pretty good game of golf , huh manny ? 
8537 => we havent got to the course yet . 
8538 => oh , i can tell by the swing , youve been playing for a long time . 
8539 => been playing since i was a kid . 
8540 => played a lot with billy . 
8541 => this billy palmer played golf ? 
8542 => yeah , he was damn good . 
8543 => he could usually beat me ? 
8544 => imagine that . 
8545 => i didnt take the game up until after i came back so i never thought about any of the guys being golfers . 
8546 => you mentioned you had a son in the army , does he play ? 
8547 => no , not much . 
8548 => donny is a water-skier and golf and water-skiing dont mix . 
8549 => the skiing pulls the arms and shoulders making them longer . 
8550 => now dannymy other sonhe was serious about his golf so he didnt water-ski , but donny loved to ski , so didnt take his golf seriously . 
8551 => im not quite sure how to start , manny continued as he changed clubs from his bag . 
8552 => im not sure if you want to go back . 
8553 => it must have been a rough time ? 
8554 => no , its okay . 
8555 => it was a long time ago , and ive never had any real problems with it , just sad sometimes . 
8556 => many guys suffered for the stupidity of the whole thing . 
8557 => im kind of glad that the truth took as long as it did to really come out . 
8558 => i had a chance to mellow , otherwise who knows how i would have felt , or done , if mcnamara had of admitted what he did within a couple of years after that fiasco . 
8559 => well , im looking for guys that served with billy palmer ? 
8560 => welsh looked at manny with a doubting expression , then leaned on his club with both arms , thinking for a while . 
8561 => gosh , ive tried and tried , but the name just doesnt compute . 
8562 => i was under the impression that you were in the duc duc area on june 13 , 1967 . 
8563 => duc duc , yeah , that rings a bell . 
8564 => ive got to tell you though , i dont recall any billy palmer . 
8565 => um , june 13 , the 13th . 
8566 => dan had a serious look on his face . 
8567 => you know , the 13th was kind of a bad day . 
8568 => yes , i understand that . 
8569 => you were seriously wounded ? 
8570 => yup , i was . 
8571 => lost most of my men too , but there was no palmer , im sure of it . 
8572 => maybe he was one of the guys that got to us ? 
8573 => i think theres a good explanation why the name is unfamiliar , manny smiled , billy was a sniper . 
8574 => dan walsh straightened up , abruptly , a surprised look on his face . 
8575 => he was one of the shooters ! 
8576 => he exclaimed . 
8577 => i dont know what you mean ? 
8578 => the sniper team ! 
8579 => theyre the only reason im sitting here talking to you . 
8580 => they saved our lives . 
8581 => this palmer , billy ? 
8582 => how did you trace him to me ? 
8583 => you put him up for a medal . 
8584 => yes , yes , i never found out his name though , the sniper teams didnt like to advertise . 
8585 => i guess the nva were putting rewards on their heads . 
8586 => billy palmerwowbilly palmer , he was the one huh ? 
8587 => i saw him after it was all over . 
8588 => just for a moment , when they were putting me on the chopper . 
8589 => these two guys came up to look me over . 
8590 => you could tell they werent regular jar heads . 
8591 => they looked like they had been living in the jungle for months . 
8592 => i didnt realize what had happened , until i was trying to explain it to a corpsman . 
8593 => he said that a sniper-team had been there and they had shot up the nva attacking us . 
8594 => it was all a blur at first , but when i was in the hospital it all made sense . 
8595 => do you know the name of the other guy , there were two of them ? 
8596 => mark tainer , i just visited him up in new york . 
8597 => i have his address and numbers if youd like . 
8598 => hes the one that put me on to you . 
8599 => hell yes ! 
8600 => this tainer , hes alive and well ? 
8601 => yeah , hes alive and well enough to chew the shit out of me . 
8602 => could you tell me about it ; what happened that day ? 
8603 => oh gosh , let me think about it . 
8604 => ah , im not sure if i can be all that accurate , but ill try . 
8605 => ah , um , we were on a search and destroy , and my platoon was to circle around a village and set up a blocking force . 
8606 => i was hoping that we wouldnt have any contact that day . 
8607 => i had three brand new men , they didnt even have jungle boots yet . 
8608 => jungle boots had treads , the regular issue boots had smooth bottoms and were a bitch in the slippery mud . 
8609 => im not sure what happened , but we came out of the jungle on this trail , and all hell broke loose . 
8610 => we were cut off . 
8611 => * lt 
8612 => walsh screams at his men , as the incoming bullets tear into the ground and the edge of the jungle next to the path they are on . 
8613 => some of his men are already hit , he can hear the screaming , but he has no idea how many , or how bad . 
8614 => as he tries to reach his fallen comrades , the enemy fires ferociously into his position , the snapping bullets hurting his ears , shredding everything above the ground , violent geysers of mud and water everywhere . 
8615 => the jungle they have just came out of is full of flashes , and he knows the only way to go is in the opposite direction ; if there is any hope of getting out of the ambush . 
8616 => he cant believe that they walked right through the enemy like that without noticing anything . 
8617 => he figures there must be at least twenty nva firing on him and his men . 
8618 => he and his remaining men , five he can see , have gotten down behind the back of the trail , but they need to do something quickly . 
8619 => he shouts to return fire , but the nose is deafening and he can see that all the men are pinned down . 
8620 => the heavy incoming fire keeps them below the dike . 
8621 => he knows they have to return fire and he pushes his m-16 up over the dike , keeping his head below cover and pulls the trigger . 
8622 => it feels like ten thousand volts hits his hands . 
8623 => he pulls his hands back down and realizes that the m-16 is gone and he is looking at blood . 
8624 => he looks to his rear and realizes they are at the edge of a grassy hill and on top of the hill sits a small stone temple . 
8625 => the small field is surrounded by jungle and grass covered hills . 
8626 => the enemy fire slows , and he takes stock of his situation . 
8627 => it is getting foggy and starting to rain heavy . 
8628 => he calls to his men and only five respond with gestures only . 
8629 => he senses that they are afraid , like he is and hesitant to reveal their positions by making noise . 
8630 => he is uncertain on what to do . 
8631 => he knows that if they stay where they are , the enemy can sneak right up to them , the dike affording them the cover . 
8632 => he realizes , if the enemy moves up to the other side , they can just lob grenades over and it will be all over for him and his men . 
8633 => lt 
8634 => walsh takes one of his grenades , pulls the pin and throws it over the dike in the direction of the enemy . 
8635 => he signals his closest man to do the same , then the next man in line to repeat the action . 
8636 => he knows , that at most , his men are carrying two maybe three grenades each and this holding action can not last long . 
8637 => he sees that his radio operator is still with him and he decides that if they can make the small temple a hundred feet out in the field , there might be a chance to call in artillery . 
8638 => it is their only hope he decides . 
8639 => he moves laterally to each of his men and instructs them of his plan . 
8640 => he is not sure if they will respond to his commands and move out of the cover , but he decides to chance it . 
8641 => he tells each man that it is their only choice , if they stay there , they will die . 
8642 => he gives the signal and shouts , running hard and low . 
8643 => the five marines , with their officer , take off running from the dike , turning , firing back into the jungle to the rear as they flee . 
8644 => one marine goes down , hit as the enemy resumes firing at the retreating marines . 
8645 => the rest continue to move toward the shelter of the stone temple . 
8646 => another marine is hit , a third marine , the radio operator , stops and turns to help and is hit almost immediately . 
8647 => only three marines remain , struggling up the slope . 
8648 => the marine that was hit first is not out of action and has turned back toward the jungle , firing until the magazine in his rifle is empty . 
8649 => he is fumbling around , trying to insert another fresh magazine , when a north vietnamese soldier appears at the edge of the dike . 
8650 => the marine has the new magazine inserted and raises his m-16 to shoot . 
8651 => there is a loud , snap , and the nvas head explodes and he is driven back into the jungle . 
8652 => the marine starts shooting at the jungle , but the area around him erupts in sod , mud and grass chunks flung into the air obscuring him . 
8653 => the three remaining marines are fifty yards from the temple , lt 
8654 => wash hanging back a bit , looking back to his men that are down . 
8655 => the nearest marine is lying in a mass of mud and blood , motionless . 
8656 => sporadic shooting from the jungle is directed at the remaining three marines . 
8657 => the three sometimes turn to return fire while trying to reach the temple , now only twenty feet ahead . 
8658 => two nva appear at the edge of the dike , only showing their heads and shoulders and aiming their rifles at the fleeing marines . 
8659 => there is another , snap , and one of the nva takes a bullet directly in the face , twitches a moment and is still . 
8660 => the other enemy soldier doesnt realize what has happened to his comrade . 
8661 => he aims at the retreating marines as they try to reach the temple . 
8662 => a bullet strikes the ground between the second nvas arms , ricocheting up , blowing a hole in his chest . 
8663 => he tries to stand up , but flops over sideways , rolling into the jungle . 
8664 => the three remaining marines reach the temple , the last one , lt 
8665 => walsh , is hit in the back , as the other two men jump behind the safety of the stone . 
8666 => the lt 
8667 => is flat on his face and trying to crawl , to get around to the safety of the temple . 
8668 => one of his men reaches out and pulls him behind the stone . 
8669 => a heavy barrage of small arms fire erupts from the jungle , directed at the stone . 
8670 => the temple is obliterated by flying chips and the ground around it pulverized . 
8671 => the marines behind the temple stay behind the stone , as a steady stream of bullets strike the stone and surrounding ground . 
8672 => ten nva jump over the dike and start toward the temple , firing steadily to keep the marines pinned . 
8673 => the nva move in a line up the hill , one aiming at the first marine that was hit earlier . 
8674 => the enemy soldier is poised to shoot , when there is another loud , snap , and he flings his rifle out and spins around , going down hard . 
8675 => his comrades either dont notice or are so intent that they just continue on , firing and progressing up the hill . 
8676 => another , snap , and the nva , second from the right in the advancing line , jumps back , his legs flying out from under him and flops hard onto his back . 
8677 => the nva soldier closest to him stops and looks confused . 
8678 => another , snap , and this soldier takes a vicious hit in the upper torso that drives him back , violently . 
8679 => he tries to get to his feet , his hands clamped to his chest , blood spurting through his fingers . 
8680 => five more nva are on the dike , starting over . 
8681 => a light automatic weapon fires a long burst from their left , three of the nva going down , the other two scrambling back into the protection of the jungle . 
8682 => the lead nva out in the field , only fifty feet from the temple goes down to his one knee and fires a sustained rhythm of shots into the stone , keeping the marines pinned behind the cover . 
8683 => two nva start to circle wide , to get a shot around the sides of the stone . 
8684 => another , snap , and the nva that has moved to the right , grabs his chest , a look of bewilderment on his face . 
8685 => he topples over as another nva runs up behind him , pulling at his shoulder , turning him around , a bright red splotch growing on his back and side . 
8686 => the second nva is on one knee , looking around , when there is another , snap , and his face disappears in a cloud of bloody spray . 
8687 => the nva that has been keeping the marines pinned , runs out of ammunition and feels frantically for a fresh magazine . 
8688 => another loud , snap , is heard , the nva pitching back violently , a following boom coming from the grass covered hill , slightly to the right and beyond the small field the temple is in . 
8689 => the five remaining nva are confused , looking around , uncertain what to do next . 
8690 => they start toward the temple again , but their rate of fire has decreased . 
8691 => one of the marines suddenly pokes his head and his m-16 out from behind the temple and fires a long burst at the nva , taking two of them out , and just as quickly disappearing back behind the stone . 
8692 => one of the remaining nva , starts yelling , shooting , and running at the temple . 
8693 => he gets about ten feet from the stone , when there is another loud , snap , and he appears to run into a brick wall , bouncing back , sitting down hard , and another , boom , resounding from the hill . 
8694 => he looks startled and slowly tips over on his side , twitching , a stream of blood spurting out of his chest . 
8695 => another marine pokes out from the temple to fire , but one of the nva is able to shoot first , hitting the marine in the upper chest , the marine going down hard and not moving . 
8696 => the nva that did the shooting , starts toward the temple , firing paced shots into the stone to keep the two remaining marines back behind it . 
8697 => the nva is five feet from getting around and getting a clear shot at the marines when another loud , snap , coincides with his head disintegrating . 
8698 => the body tips forward , starting toward the ground , as another boom , emanates from the far jungle . 
8699 => another nva rushes forward , and another , snap , signals his demise , the following boom , coming from the same location in the far off jungle . 
8700 => the last remaining nva , the one to the left , runs toward the temple , reaching the side of it . 
8701 => i was hit really bad , twice actually , and ellington was the only one left still able to fight . 
8702 => walsh continued , almost out of breath . 
8703 => i cant really remember exactly how it went , but ellington had gone around one of the sides . 
8704 => im not sure left or right , and was banging it out with whoever . 
8705 => screaming , fuckin take this , or something like that . 
8706 => i was propped up on the back of the stone and turned in the opposite direction of ellington . 
8707 => i had my forty-five out with my good hand and had it stuck out in front of me . 
8708 => i just remember this nva , all of a sudden , right there in front of me , that fuckin ak , and im looking right down the barrel . 
8709 => i was trying to raise my forty-five and this nva , just drops , i dont know ? 
8710 => i was in bad shape , but i can remember this nva is hammered , or something like that . 
8711 => one moment he is standing right there , ready to kill me , and the next he is down , and the only memory of that whole war , that really sticks out in my mind , is the ooof that guy made . 
8712 => its not clear , but the next thing i know a corpsman is working on me . 
8713 => i asked him what had happened and he said we were lucky as shit the shooters had been there ? 
8714 => i made out the report and recommended whoever had saved our asses a medal , but i never got the names . 
8715 => i guess the corps was reluctant to identify the snipers and i didnt press the issue . 
8716 => ellington came to see me in the hospital ; he was the only one without a scratch , but he said he had a chunk out of one boot , a gash in his web belt , a magazine with a hole in it , and he was covered in c-rations because two cans in his pack stopped bullets . 
8717 => welsh stopped and thought for a moment . 
8718 => how do you know it was your buddy palmer ? 
8719 => how can you be sure ? 
8720 => i just found out he received the silver star for the action you described . 
8721 => just found out ? 
8722 => i thought you were friends , how is that possible ? 
8723 => billy never said anything about any medals to us . 
8724 => never said anything about vietnam . 
8725 => what can you say ? 
8726 => dan said with a sound of reverence in his voice . 
8727 => its not something that anyone can really understand , unless they can say , been there done that , experienced it . 
8728 => i never figured that the guy , dan continued , that saved our lives enjoyed this game . 
8729 => over there golf was so foreign , so alien to our thoughts . 
8730 => we played football , basketball , baseball , pool , they even had a bowling alley in da nang , but golf was a totally exotic thing for me back then . 
8731 => * manny thoroughly enjoyed the day of golf with walsh . 
8732 => usually an outing on the golf course took the edge off him and he could go on home , relax and get into bed early . 
8733 => normally he could also relax in a motel room , but this evening he felt like getting out , traveling a little . 
8734 => * manny checked out , rented a car , and headed north , toward georgia . 
8735 => he figured to rent a room someplace up there , then reschedule his flight the next day . 
8736 => how does someone survive that kind of terror ? 
8737 => manny contemplated as he drove down the highway , the story walsh had told him still fresh in his mind . 
8738 => how can they continue to function after something like that ? 
8739 => manny was again going over the story dan walsh had told him . 
8740 => christ , id fold up , i know i would , manny said to himself . 
8741 => i dont know how else id get through something so intense . 
8742 => what does it take to operate in chaos like that ? 
8743 => the intensity of the narration by the ex-marine lieutenant had stimulated something in manny . 
8744 => he had seen all the new war movies , the stark reality of saving private ryan had moved him , but hearing the details from someone that had experienced something so terrifying and raw , left manny with a feeling of being left out . 
8745 => no wonder he never said anything to us about the war . 
8746 => how the hell could he have explained something like that to a bunch of spoiled children like us ? 
8747 => * he entered the state of georgia as it got dark , the full moon just rising up from the horizon . 
8748 => manny left the main highway , opting for the back roads sometime around midnight . 
8749 => the full moon was at its zenith in the night sky , bathing the highway and surrounding landscape with its soft white light . 
8750 => he drove until he came to a long skinny lake , surrounded by trees and small hills . 
8751 => the lakes surface gleamed silver in the moonlight . 
8752 => he turned off onto a small paved road , heading away from the water , heading deeper into the surrounding forest . 
8753 => the road meandered up a valley flanked by large trees and thick brush . 
8754 => he rounded a corner and pulled off into a small overlook on the right side of the road . 
8755 => the ground dropped away from the road . 
8756 => * manny was tired of driving and stopped the car . 
8757 => the heavy growth along both sides of the road looked almost impenetrable . 
8758 => he wasnt sure what he was looking for as he got out of the car and walked over to the thick vegetation . 
8759 => he parted the first layer , a tangle of bushes under the large trees that spread their branches over the road . 
8760 => there was enough of the moons light filtering through the trees for manny to see a little and he stepped from the road into the forest . 
8761 => manny crashed through the thick undergrowth for a few feet and was ready to turn around when he came to a break in the foliage . 
8762 => it wasnt much , but appeared to be a game trail . 
8763 => manny still had to walk bent over to take advantage of the trail as he continued on . 
8764 => the trail moved off to the left , gradually descending the hill . 
8765 => a hundred feet ahead , the trail reached the bottom of the slope and started gradually up the next hill . 
8766 => the vegetation on the next hill was a little less dense because the many large trees shielded the ground from direct sunlight . 
8767 => part way up the slope , manny came to a rock cap , an outcrop of granite forming a large bald spot in the ever encompassing vegetation . 
8768 => manny detoured a little left , going up the smooth rock . 
8769 => the climbing was harder , the angle was slightly steeper and it was difficult getting solid footing . 
8770 => the smooth cap was coated with a thin film of tiny grains of sand . 
8771 => manny climbed the outcrop to where it dove back into the earth , and the vegetation took over again . 
8772 => there were larger trees here , the undergrowth less dense , and manny could see some large rocks protruding up on the crest of the hill . 
8773 => manny found a small nitch near the crest of the hill , a spot two feet square , under a large spreading tree . 
8774 => large rocks standing high behind him formed the top of the hill . 
8775 => from there he could see down the slope to the front , but his sides and rear were protected by the rocks . 
8776 => manny made himself comfortable in the rocks , the cold , damp night air surrounding him . 
8777 => what if they were coming for me here , what could i do ? 
8778 => how could i save myself ? 
8779 => what do i know ? 
8780 => he said out loud . 
8781 => nothing you smuck . 
8782 => youre a retail exec , not a lot of experience with anything that counts , now . 
8783 => youre damn lucky you live in such a placid environment , otherwise you would be toast . 
8784 => manny huddled under the tree , his knees pulled up tight to his chest , his arms wrapped around his legs , looking out into the moonlight , thinking . 
8785 => i wonder if my bow would be any good here ? 
8786 => i could probably get a couple of them . 
8787 => is that what a soldier thinks ? 
8788 => im not going to make it , so what the hell , im going to take as many as i can with me ? 
8789 => is that what being brave is all about ? 
8790 => is that what makes a person charge certain death , being angry about being there ? 
8791 => what causes the line to be crossed from scared to angry . 
8792 => i wonder if i would handle it or not ? 
8793 => manny contemplated the problem and fantasied about making his stand until he got cold and returned to his car . 
8794 => chapter 14 hello manny , i didnt expect to see you so soon , mark tainer said , walking into the reception area of his office . 
8795 => i hope im not infringing on you , manny said defensively , as he rose up to greet the man , but im headed home from florida and i decided to swing by here to see if maybe you had just a little time ? 
8796 => got a little this morning , whats on your mind ? 
8797 => tainer said , heading into his office , manny following . 
8798 => i met with the lieutenant of that platoon you and billy saved . 
8799 => all in a days work manny , have a seat . 
8800 => what did he have to say ? 
8801 => he hasnt called you , i gave him your number ? 
8802 => ive got a pile of messages here on my desk , what was his name ? 
8803 => dan walsh . 
8804 => walsh . 
8805 => . 
8806 => .let me see , yeah , here it is . 
8807 => ill try to get back to him later on this week , but right now im swamped . 
8808 => did you get the book i overnighted , the one billy wrote , timtown ? 
8809 => yeah i did , tainer hesitated , apparently his mind was on something else , but to tell you the truth , i havent gotten to it yet . 
8810 => i sent it to one of my readers , i should hear back after the holidays . 
8811 => i thought you would look at it ? 
8812 => oh , i will , but i get someone else to clean it up first . 
8813 => ah , you know , my wife did that already . 
8814 => i mean cleaned up by a professional . 
8815 => i get so strapped for time , i cant get involved in editing . 
8816 => the better it gets to my desk , the more apt i am to give it the attention it deserves . 
8817 => im envious of billy for finding the time , somewhere , to write anything . 
8818 => i think ive got some great stories , but i dont have the time to put them down . 
8819 => can you imagine that ? 
8820 => oh , its just that my wife is so thrilled about it , she just cant wait to hear back from you . 
8821 => manny was a little miffed about the professional remark because it was a personal affront to cassey who he considered intellectually superior to most anybody , but thought better of mentioning it . 
8822 => when you do get around to it , just call her okay ? 
8823 => ive been taking a lot of time on this thing with billy , and now cassey is getting involved , and the book is her end of the deal . 
8824 => i understand manny , as soon as i can get to it , i will call her . 
8825 => thanks , i appreciate that . 
8826 => look , i know youre busy , so ill get going . 
8827 => i just wanted to say thanks , the talk with lieutenant walsh was eye opening . 
8828 => you and billy were really heroes and you certainly deserved the medals . 
8829 => im curious though , who was doing the shooting from the hill , you or billy ? 
8830 => it was me from the position up on the hill . 
8831 => i dont know what happened to billy . 
8832 => we saw what was going down , and billy took off , down the hill , toward the ambush . 
8833 => he must have gotten in close , im sure . 
8834 => after the choppers left , it took him half an hour to reload all the magazines he had emptied . 
8835 => wow , i cant even imagine something so intense . 
8836 => how did you keep from crapping in your pants ? 
8837 => who said i didnt ? 
8838 => tainer smiled . 
8839 => manny just nodded , appreciating the admission . 
8840 => i got to the wall , he added . 
8841 => what did you think ? 
8842 => it was devastating after i figured it all out . 
8843 => anyone that has any doubts about that war , needs to go through the experience . 
8844 => what did it tell you ? 
8845 => how utterly ridiculous it was to stay there and just keep on throwing away all those lives , for nothing . 
8846 => how the hell could something like that happen ? 
8847 => like i told you before , vietnam was a research and development policy that was okay , except the costs were way to high and no one knew when to end it . 
8848 => vietnam was an engineers delight , look at what they learned about helicopters . 
8849 => the latest generation of them are a direct yield of what they learned in that war . 
8850 => shit , cant they find another way to test their theories ? 
8851 => if youve got questions about how well something is going to work , or if it will at all , theres no substitute for the real thing . 
8852 => theyre still doing it . 
8853 => look at iraq and afghanistan . 
8854 => the military needs to test . 
8855 => no better place than to find a dictator to kick around now and then , keeps everybody sharp . 
8856 => vietnam taught us that . 
8857 => before you send in the troops , demoralize the opposition . 
8858 => when the first of your troops arrive , you want the enemy to be looking forward to having them there , to surrender to , not to fight . 
8859 => i guess . 
8860 => the present day special forces operational manuals were written back in vietnam . 
8861 => we were operating independently and learning as we went . 
8862 => what we passed on to them and what they have learned in addition make them extremely proficient . 
8863 => they owe a lot to a guy like billy , an independent thinker like he was . 
8864 => there were others too . 
8865 => did i tell you about obrien yet ? 
8866 => no . 
8867 => millard obrien , aka bat obrien , outhouse junction , tennessee . 
8868 => outhouse ? 
8869 => manny laughed . 
8870 => yeah , thats what bat claimed . 
8871 => he said he lived where nobody had any maps yet . 
8872 => i could believe it as back woods as he was . 
8873 => he was skinny , about five foot four , a hundred and twenty pounds soaking wet . 
8874 => homely as hell , red hair , freckles , big ass ears that stuck straight out to the side , thats where he got the moniker bat . 
8875 => bat was the result of cousins with cousins , going way back , im sure , but , bat obrien could hit a fly at a hundred yards . 
8876 => we were all good shots , but he was way beyond us . 
8877 => he was the ultimate hunter . 
8878 => sometimes hed stay out for three weeks , living on the land . 
8879 => he used to wear the uniforms of the guys he bagged . 
8880 => thats creepy ! 
8881 => manny said . 
8882 => that was bat all right . 
8883 => he wouldnt swear either , claimed god dont like cussin ! 
8884 => i asked him about his lust for killing one time , and he told me he was just doing gods work , cleansing the kingdom of them heathens . 
8885 => it got to the point that the other guys didnt want to go out with him , hed stay too long , so he went by himself . 
8886 => bat was in country way before we were . 
8887 => billy went out with him a couple of times when we first got there , to learn the ropes , he said . 
8888 => after we had been there , like eight months , bat never came back this one time , but i find it hard to believe the vc got him . 
8889 => i think hes still out there to tell you the truth . 
8890 => anyway , whenever he was in the rear this major from intelligence would come down immediately to see bat . 
8891 => this major had a standing request to be called whenever bat showed up , and he would sit and listen to bat for hours , taking all these notes . 
8892 => you ever wonder who killed kennedy ? 
8893 => tainer continued . 
8894 => jfk or rfk ? 
8895 => john , who really shot him ? 
8896 => i guess oswald ? 
8897 => according to the warren commission ? 
8898 => mark asked , a cynical smile on his face . 
8899 => thats what we were told . 
8900 => ah , duped , just like it was your duty as an american . 
8901 => ive heard other theories , you can shed some light on this ? 
8902 => when we got to sniper school they said they were going to teach us to shoot like lee harvey oswald . 
8903 => it was the first time i ever thought about what really happened to kennedy , who actually did the shooting . 
8904 => the instructors were being facetious of course . 
8905 => it would have been impossible for oswald to have fired so fast and so accurate with the rifle they found . 
8906 => they were trying to impress upon us that the kennedy assassination was a conspiracy . 
8907 => no shit , oswald really didnt do it ? 
8908 => not all by himself he didnt . 
8909 => of course the truth would have really shook the government up , at that time . 
8910 => kennedy wanted to stay out of vietnam , others didnt . 
8911 => i can still remember that day , but it wasnt until sniper school that i started to question policies . 
8912 => you wouldnt believe how stupid the system can get . 
8913 => i can remember the time , tainer continued , we got this asshole sergeant in our unit . 
8914 => sergeant schnelling , what a rube , a real lifer . 
8915 => i dont know how the hell we ended up with him , but we did . 
8916 => he was an admin clown and i guess they decided that we needed to keep some records and so there he was . 
8917 => i think he had been in the crotch like 18 years , and already a sergeant , a real bozo . 
8918 => he is there like two days and already we couldnt stand him . 
8919 => billy and i were just corporals at the time , so he outranked us and he immediately started to push his weight around . 
8920 => he had it to , big fuckin beer belly , smoked like a chimney , lived for coffee and smokes . 
8921 => so anyway here comes sergeant dildo , as billy called him , and he is all spit and polish . 
8922 => weve got guys living in this hooch when were in base camp , out of the field . 
8923 => we spend all this time out and clean uniforms and polished boots are not our priority , considering that out in the field we tried to blend in , which means looking ratty as hell . 
8924 => old sergeant suck up goes to the head quarters company commander and complains that the s-2 bunch , scout-snipers , thats us , are a disgrace and he intends to do something about it . 
8925 => the company commander comes over to our hooch to check us out . 
8926 => billy explains that the time we spent in the rear is not for spit and polish , but for training the new guys and things like that . 
8927 => this major knows about us and kind of agrees . 
8928 => we dont stand company formations because not our ratty asses tarnish the clean and disciplined ranks , but schnelling demands that we be present for the company inspection that afternoon . 
8929 => so here we are , standing at attention , dirty as shit , no new uniforms or anything like that , and some flunky officer wanting us to present arms . 
8930 => hell , i couldnt even remember how it went . 
8931 => billy never did come to attention . 
8932 => hes standing there , leaning on his m-16 and when this officer gets to him , billy hands the officer the rifle , butt first . 
8933 => this is a green lewy and he doesnt know what to do and just gives billy the m-16 back and goes to the next guy . 
8934 => heres all these office weenies looking like theyre ready to march in a parade and at one end , eight guys looking like skid row bums . 
8935 => we made no attempt whatsoever to clean up . 
8936 => we never wore covers , hats , our longer shaggy hair blended in better in the bush and we seldom shaved . 
8937 => schnelling didnt say anything to us before the inspection . 
8938 => i guess he figured that were going to catch shit for the way we looked . 
8939 => so , sergeant dildo is standing there prim and proper , with a smirk on his face when the inspecting officer gets to him . 
8940 => old sarg does a beautiful present arms , the lieutenant snaps the m-16 crisply from him , pulls the bolt actuator back and it just falls back loose . 
8941 => billy had taken the bolt out of the idiots rifle and closed the dust cover . 
8942 => so heres sergeant schnelling with this god awful look on his face , and billy , myself and a couple of the other guys laying in the dust holding our guts , laughing like crazy . 
8943 => the inspection kind of fell apart at that point . 
8944 => so , the company commander , this major called us into his office . 
8945 => we didnt know what to expect , but this major was trying to be stern , to preserve discipline he said , but you could tell the whole time he was close to busting out laughing . 
8946 => schnelling , the idiot that he was , decides that he needs to get some combat time . 
8947 => it looks good on your record for promotions . 
8948 => he plans this little patrol and gets the okay from the company commander . 
8949 => billy goes to the major and tries to talk him out of letting schnelling go into the field , but the major says that it isnt a long one , just out to a couple of villages and then back , so what can go wrong ? 
8950 => billy wasnt too happy , but we were stuck . 
8951 => schnelling plans this little foray and he keeps it short because i know hes scared . 
8952 => its about two clicks out and then right back . 
8953 => were not too worried about the vc , we know these two villages and theyre too close to the fire base for anything but a couple of local vc . 
8954 => we take two shooters , knowing the sniper rifles will make anyone out there think twice about taking a shot at us . 
8955 => weve got a couple of new guys and billy and i want to familiarize them with what to look for , that sort of thing . 
8956 => we go out to the first village and then turn . 
8957 => schnelling had made this over lay for the artillery base , with fire coordinates preset . 
8958 => he actually did a good job . 
8959 => so the point , this guy lujak , with one of the new guys comes to the trail running off to the right . 
8960 => he sees that the villagers have been walking down off the trail and he informs the new guy , cant remember his name , that the trail is more than likely booby trapped . 
8961 => schnelling sees the point go off the trail and starts yelling . 
8962 => if there is any way to get a guy thats used to quiet and covert , pissed , its some fuckin idiot making too much noise . 
8963 => schnelling wont settle down about his orders not being followed , and i was worried that billy might end up shooting him . 
8964 => the c.o . 
8965 => had warned us that if anything happened to schnelling , he was damn sure going to find out why ? 
8966 => i finally got the dumb fuck to shut up by the time billy came up from the rear to see what the hell the problem was . 
8967 => schnelling was incensed that the point guys had deviated from his well laid plans . 
8968 => lujak came back and told us why , so billy told him to go back up and proceed with caution . 
8969 => sergeant dildo starts arguing again , and i cant believe it . 
8970 => hes yelling at billy about how he out ranks him and its his patrol so we do what he says . 
8971 => billy tells him to shut the fuck up , that hes broadcasting our position . 
8972 => im trying to explain to the dumb fuck why we dont walk down trails that all the locals avoid , and he pulls his forty-five out and starts yelling about court martials and shooting people for disobeying orders . 
8973 => i mean , here were are , seven guys out in the fuckin sticks and this asshole you can hear for miles . 
8974 => at that point , i know billys going to shoot him , i just know it for sure , but stanton , one of the guys that had been with us for a while , steps in and kicks the sergeant right in the balls . 
8975 => i mean , lifted him right off the ground . 
8976 => shut him up and saved his ass ! 
8977 => the dumb fuck pressed charges , as soon as we get back . 
8978 => this is some serious shit , disobeying an order in combat . 
8979 => some asshole from the judge advocates office comes looking for heads to bash . 
8980 => billy , myself , and lujak are named in the court-martial . 
8981 => i guess schnelling was grateful to stanton and didnt include him in the charges . 
8982 => we all have to fill out this report . 
8983 => theyve got mps standing over us and everything . 
8984 => two of the line company commanders saved our asses . 
8985 => we had a good record with them and they pointed out the ridiculous actions of the sergeant to the guy from the jag . 
8986 => they sent the sergeant somewhere where he couldnt cause any more problems , i guess . 
8987 => the battalion base commander , a colonel , said that all the rigmarole with the jag made him look bad , and that from that point on , we , the snipers , would be dressed according to the uniform of the day while on his post . 
8988 => the next day , were playing football on the parade ground , and this colonel sees us out there , running around in cut off utility shorts , and no shirts , but we had all shaved . 
8989 => he comes rushing over and starts babbling about how we are disobeying a direct order , we are out of uniform . 
8990 => billys talking to him , explaining that its ninety-five degrees with ninety percent humidity , and that full uniforms would be pretty silly , especially when the uniform of the day is not required for any sports or calisthenics . 
8991 => the colonel comes unglued and starts yelling at billy , dressing him down as a malcontent . 
8992 => billy doesnt say anything until this guy finally burns himself out . 
8993 => the next day billy organizes the football game again , but this time were out there in shirts , long pants , boots , the uniform of the day . 
8994 => we were wondering whats up ? 
8995 => we didnt feel like playing football in the heat dressed like that , but billy said to just do it , it would be worth it . 
8996 => we knew he was up to something so we went along . 
8997 => the colonels tent and private privy were down at the end of the field . 
8998 => were playing football , sweating like pigs and the colonel comes by and tells us he appreciates our trying to conform , that its essential for everyone 's moral . 
8999 => that we are all the same here in camp , no one is special . 
9000 => he struts off and goes into his private john . 
9001 => this private privy is about the size of a toilet stall and its closed off with canvas . 
9002 => it had this big ass water tank over it for flushing . 
9003 => there was a pull rope attached to a check valve up on the tank to allow only a little water to come out , just enough to flush the toilet . 
9004 => the colonel goes in and we just keep on playing football . 
9005 => billys got this big smirk on his face , and we havent got the slightest inkling why . 
9006 => all of a sudden , we hear this shouting and swearing coming from the colonels privy and then water coming out of the bottom of the canvas . 
9007 => next thing we know , the flap flies open and the colonel , with his pants down around his ankles , comes stumbling out , falling flat on his face in the mud , his white ass sticking up , covered with shit . 
9008 => his orderly rushes up and tries to help him up , but the colonel is all twisted in his trousers and having a tirade . 
9009 => we figure it was a good time to skedaddle , but billy said bullshit , were playing football and he wasnt about to miss any of this . 
9010 => it took a few minutes for the colonel to get straightened out , but he was still covered with mud and swearing . 
9011 => most of the camp was there by now and everyone was standing watching , except us , we just went on with our game , not paying any attention . 
9012 => it was real obvious that we probably had something to do with it . 
9013 => they checked the privy , and it seems that someone had removed the check valve return spring from the overhead water tank , so instead of just a measured amount of water coming down to flush his toilet , the whole tank empty itself while the colonel was still sitting on the pot . 
9014 => a big stink was brewing , the colonel was going to try and arrest all of us , but an mp major came from da nang . 
9015 => he was called to investigate an attempt to jeopardized the colonels well-being , but after he researched the incident , he came to the conclusion that an enema was not life threatening . 
9016 => the colonel said that , tomorrow , the whole bunch of us would be sorry , but in the morning there wasnt a sniper to be found . 
9017 => we all slipped out that night . 
9018 => we gradually came back after about a week , a team at a time , but the thing had blown over . 
9019 => the colonel had tried to get somebody higher up to take his humiliation seriously , but we heard all he got was a bunch of snickers when the story got around . 
9020 => the commander of the sniper school , a two star , personally came and calmed him down , said boys will be boys , or something to that effect . 
9021 => that colonel , was still giving us dirty looks , till the day i left . 
9022 => one of billys favorites was messing with fresh officers . 
9023 => back in the rear , around da nang , it was still customary to salute , sometimes . 
9024 => we never did of course , hell we never wore rank , so nobody knew if we were officers , or enlisted . 
9025 => billy would walk by officers , and just when wed get abreast , hed shout , good morning , or good afternoon sir , whatever was appropriate and just keep on walking . 
9026 => the officers would spin around to accept the acknowledgment , and get our backs as we were walking away . 
9027 => you wouldnt believe it , but some of those idiots would try to make an issue out of it . 
9028 => it was hilarious , some boy wonder trying to get the mps to charge us with insubordination or some stupid thing , and the mps trying to explain , to this guy , that there was really nothing they could do , considering who we were . 
9029 => anytime there was a beef the normal thing was to go to a marines commanding officer , but that didnt really apply to us . 
9030 => the head of the mps in da nang personally requested that we cut the crap because he had more important issues than officers being insulted . 
9031 => billy and i would go into da nang , once in a while with captured gear . 
9032 => for two ak 47s we could get a pallet of beer delivered to the base . 
9033 => one ak for the beer and one for the delivery . 
9034 => thats a lot of beer , manny commented . 
9035 => i have no idea . 
9036 => we were never there , warm falstaff was not our idea of a good time . 
9037 => billy joked he was spoiled because minnesotans always had cold beer . 
9038 => aside from the screwing around , billy was a good teacher and he really went out of his way with new guys . 
9039 => we lost a couple in the first month due to stupid mistakes , and from then on billy worked hard to familiarize everyone with what to expect . 
9040 => he had this exercise called blind mans bluff . 
9041 => did he ever tell you about it ? 
9042 => no , never heard of it ? 
9043 => billy used it to get new guys mellowed out about being out in the jungle , alone . 
9044 => when youre out there waiting is what you do most of the time . 
9045 => it can get really boring and your mind can wander . 
9046 => if somebodys inexperienced the idle time can get them to thinking about the wrong thing , so billy devised ways to focus . 
9047 => one was blind mans bluff . 
9048 => you would start just before dawn and pretend you were blind , which wasnt far from the truth . 
9049 => in the jungle its so dark you cant see a thing , your eyes are worthless , and so you must use the other senses . 
9050 => it is not the kind of situation that you can afford to be out of touch with your surroundings . 
9051 => you would concentrate on the other senses , and it is incredible what you can hear , smell , feel , if you cant see anything . 
9052 => as it starts to get light you concentrate on combining the new sense , sight , and the others . 
9053 => it works , it focuses your mind to your surroundings . 
9054 => many of the guys would be uptight until they practiced this a couple of times . 
9055 => you do the opposite in the evening . 
9056 => i still practice it when im burned out or stressed . 
9057 => you should try it . 
9058 => of course now it would be irrelevant , mark tainer laughed . 
9059 => i went to the va for a complete physical a couple of years ago and they told me my eyes are still pretty good , but not like they used to be . 
9060 => my night vision is terrible , and my hearing isnt worth a shit . 
9061 => i wouldnt last a day in that environment now . 
9062 => i couldnt sneak up on a blind man anymore . 
9063 => i cant imagine you guys being so calm about what you were doing , id be a wreck , manny said . 
9064 => you needed a philosophy to stay sane and efficient . 
9065 => mine was that the enemy was better off not knowing we were there , then we didnt have to kill them . 
9066 => i remember one time we had stumbled into a bunker complex without them knowing it . 
9067 => fuckin nva all over the place . 
9068 => we were a little surprised too . 
9069 => we had a hell of a time getting back out without being discovered . 
9070 => at one point i was about ten feet from this nva and he was looking right at me , but didnt see me in the foliage . 
9071 => i kept thinking , buddy , dont screw up and spot me , or youre dead . 
9072 => you never got scared ? 
9073 => sure i was scared , but i did what i had to do , thats all . 
9074 => i dont remember billy ever really sweating the missions though , except his door gunner stint . 
9075 => we got to know some of the pilots and one said we could serve a rotation as a door gunner on his huey gun-ship . 
9076 => billy went first , he was excited about not having to be on the ground . 
9077 => i guess it was a little unnerving because when he got back , he recommended that i forget the whole thing . 
9078 => i believed him and didnt take my turn . 
9079 => he said that they would fly six or seven missions a day and that made the odds look bad . 
9080 => he was sitting on the skids , one day , with an ammo box full of sandwiches between his knees . 
9081 => when he looked down the box was gone and there was a hole in the floor . 
9082 => theyd come back from missions and the ship would be full of holes . 
9083 => they got shot down one time and he said it was not a very safe way to fight a war , they made too good a target . 
9084 => mark got a call and told manny that he had business . 
9085 => manny said he too had to hit the road because he had made plans to visit billys mother next . 
9086 => tainer said to call anytime . 
9087 => chapter 15 i hope im not disturbing you mrs 
9088 => palmer ? 
9089 => manny apologized , as billys mother welcomed him into her home . 
9090 => oh no , it was nice of you to come see me , i dont get many visitors anymore , not since my husband died . 
9091 => gwen is so far away , down there in texas , and kris is always working so hard he never gets any time to spend with his own mother . 
9092 => you still up there in red pine ? 
9093 => yes , its still a great place to live , except the winters are getting tougher to accept . 
9094 => of course i can get away much more now . 
9095 => thats nice . 
9096 => i went to texas for christmas once , but it was just too hard on me , all that traveling and the cost . 
9097 => my word , i cant believe how much it was , over three hundred dollars , just to go to texas and back . 
9098 => that must have been some time ago mrs 
9099 => palmer ? 
9100 => yes , it was the year after my husband died . 
9101 => he never wanted to go see gwen . 
9102 => i can tolerate her new husband , but my husband just couldnt overlook other peoples faults . 
9103 => tom has always been a heck of a good person mrs 
9104 => palmer , i cant see why your husband wouldve had a problem there ? 
9105 => oh , he was much too critical of peoples imperfections . 
9106 => if they didnt come up to his standards , he wouldnt have a thing to do with them . 
9107 => i always got along with him . 
9108 => you were young , so he could overlook your faults . 
9109 => when he figured you were a man though , then you had to straighten up . 
9110 => he didnt give billy the same consideration , if i remember correctly . 
9111 => billy got a roof over his head and meals on the table . 
9112 => that was a lot more than my husband got from his father , i can tell you that . 
9113 => i guess , mrs 
9114 => palmer , but the reason i stopped was to see if you had anything of billys that pertained to vietnam ? 
9115 => no , there wasnt anything that i remember . 
9116 => billy didnt bring anything back . 
9117 => no letters , or cards , anything that he might have sent you ? 
9118 => no nothing , he didnt send anything . 
9119 => those vietnam bums got away with everything . 
9120 => my husband was in wwii and those were real soldiers , not like those pot heads they sent over there . 
9121 => they lost that war . 
9122 => our government gave them the best guns and all those fancy planes , and they still lost . 
9123 => my husband said a monkey could have won that war , with all that stuff they got . 
9124 => smoked too much pot to do anything right . 
9125 => i dont remember billy smoking any pot . 
9126 => oh , you werent his mother , i know . 
9127 => but , mrs 
9128 => palmer , i was billys best friend and we drank beer , maybe some hard stuff , but i dont remember any marijuana until after he was back from the war . 
9129 => dont tell a mother she doesnt know about whats going on with her boys , she knows . 
9130 => it must have been hard for you , having him there and not knowing what to expect . 
9131 => billy didnt care what i went through , none of those nam vets gave a darn about anything but their drugs . 
9132 => look at that campbell . 
9133 => guy didnt care about anything , but getting high , put gwen through hell . 
9134 => but , mrs 
9135 => palmer , in all fairness , billy and john campbell were very different people . 
9136 => no , they werent ! 
9137 => they were peas in a pod , those two , both the same . 
9138 => never cared about anything but themselves . 
9139 => going from woman to woman , just messing everybodys lives up . 
9140 => gee , i dont remember billy being much of a womanizer mrs 
9141 => palmer . 
9142 => oh , he had all those girlfriends , all the time . 
9143 => he was going from one to the other . 
9144 => my husband told me a lot , let me tell you . 
9145 => he knew what billy was up to . 
9146 => i wasnt in the dark about billys shenanigans , no sireey , a mother knows . 
9147 => billy was just friends with those girls . 
9148 => he was like a brother to most of the girls we knew . 
9149 => nope , a man dont hang around with a women to be her friend . 
9150 => mrs 
9151 => palmer , i think youre wrong about that . 
9152 => im not wrong manny anderson . 
9153 => youre just sticking your head in the sand . 
9154 => i didnt want to say anything , but billy was trying to steal your girlfriend too . 
9155 => my girlfriend ? 
9156 => yes , your girlfriend , the pretty blond that was always hanging on billy . 
9157 => you mean cassey miller ? 
9158 => yeah , thats the one . 
9159 => didnt you two get married ? 
9160 => yes , we did ? 
9161 => there you go , her and billy were going on behind your back and you didnt even know . 
9162 => see a mother knows . 
9163 => my husband told me everything . 
9164 => well , im sorry to inform you that youve got it all wrong . 
9165 => im the one that stole billys girlfriend . 
9166 => it was the other way around , mrs 
9167 => palmer . 
9168 => oh pooh , billy had so many girlfriends , one didnt make any difference to him . 
9169 => he fooled around so much that he never got married , or had any kids . 
9170 => if it hadnt been for kris , i would have never had any grandchildren . 
9171 => billy didnt care about me . 
9172 => he didnt care when i had to see those men in uniforms coming to my door , scaring me like that ! 
9173 => i dont think you can blame that on billy . 
9174 => he was the one doing the drugs , getting hurt because he was high all the time , and i was the one that had the uniforms coming to my door . 
9175 => they even stopped at the neighbors once because they couldnt find my house . 
9176 => walked right up to the door where his sister was babysitting . 
9177 => poor thing called me . 
9178 => now , do you think that was something that a good son and brother would have done ? 
9179 => no , but you see billy only cared about himself . 
9180 => mrs 
9181 => palmer , he was fighting a war , he wasnt getting if they were so busy fighting a war , as you say , how come they lost it , huh , how come ? 
9182 => its a long story that im working on . 
9183 => oh pish posh . 
9184 => i was a young girl when they won wwii , and ill tell you they didnt play around then . 
9185 => my husband was a sailor in that one , and i can tell you those were real fighting men . 
9186 => my husband never put his mother through what billy did to me . 
9187 => your husband was never wounded ? 
9188 => no , they were real fighting men , like i told you , and they never fooled around with drugs , got the job done . 
9189 => you know he told me all about it . 
9190 => he told me why those guys in vietnam couldnt win . 
9191 => all drugged out , chasing after those oriental whores , not doing their jobs and then coming back here , and expecting everything given to them . 
9192 => no sireey , they didnt deserve anything . 
9193 => if that war had of gone any longer , kris was going to go to canada . 
9194 => now there is a fine boy , a good son . 
9195 => you know we tried to help billy when he got back , his father and i , but he refused . 
9196 => what do you do then ? 
9197 => tried to help him , how ? 
9198 => well , first he needed to be cleansed of his sins , to make a fresh start . 
9199 => our pastor was going to re-baptize him so he would be free from the sins he committed in that godforsaken place . 
9200 => he needed to admit to his sins and then only then could he be free . 
9201 => i didnt know your family was religious . 
9202 => my husband said that was what billy needed to do . 
9203 => i see , you expected him to be a spectacle in front of your church ? 
9204 => thats what he needed ? 
9205 => to make a fresh start , yes . 
9206 => he figured that life just went on , like he had done nothing wrong . 
9207 => well , he was wrong wasnt he , he proved that . 
9208 => he never amounted to anything and it was his own fault . 
9209 => before my husband died , he told me he was so disappointed his first son never amounted to anything . 
9210 => he was so happy there was kris , kris made up for billy . 
9211 => im sorry that you understand so little . 
9212 => did you know that your son was a hero ? 
9213 => ive just visited with a man that confirmed it . 
9214 => a hero you say . 
9215 => sneaking around , shooting people in the back . 
9216 => my husband found out what he did over there and ill tell you it was despicable . 
9217 => my husband said that in wwii they shot those guys right away . 
9218 => the other sides , im sure they did . 
9219 => my husband said nobody liked those guys , so secretive and all that . 
9220 => that was just like billy when he got back , never saying anything , just watching . 
9221 => ill tell you , we didnt trust him . 
9222 => never know when those guys could explode . 
9223 => use to worry my husband a lot . 
9224 => we had gwen and kris to worry about . 
9225 => couldnt have billy going off and hurting them . 
9226 => i remember billy being really good to those kids . 
9227 => i know some of kriss friends really liked billy , he watched out for all of them well , my husband and i would have never let billy hurt any of those kids . 
9228 => im telling you , he would have never hurt anybody , you didnt have to worry , mrs 
9229 => palmer . 
9230 => manny was angry because we didnt let him ! 
9231 => arent you listening to me manny anderson , you need to remember , a mother knows . 
9232 => oh , im listening , but im not believing what im hearing . 
9233 => i think ill just go mrs 
9234 => palmer . 
9235 => have a nice day . 
9236 => chapter 16 mr 
9237 => ted gannet , my name is manny anderson , and i understand that you knew a bill palmer ? 
9238 => manny asked into the telephone in his kitchen , back home again . 
9239 => name doesnt ring a bell , offhand , gannet answered . 
9240 => i have information that says a william , billy palmer worked for you in the middle eighties . 
9241 => like i said , i dont recall im not an investigator for anyone , mr 
9242 => gannet . 
9243 => im simply looking for information about somebodys life , and your name came up . 
9244 => i am not out to hurt anyone . 
9245 => how do i know that ? 
9246 => i can give you my number , and you call here . 
9247 => youll see that im nothing more than a retail exec . 
9248 => if you were up to no good that would be an excellent cover , now wouldnt it mr 
9249 => , what was the name you used ? 
9250 => manny anderson and its my real name . 
9251 => billy was an old friend . 
9252 => where did you say you were calling from ? 
9253 => red pine minnesota . 
9254 => this palmer character from there too ? 
9255 => yes , he was . 
9256 => well , i remember palmer telling me he was from some small minnesota town , red something , so i guess you could have known him . 
9257 => you did know him then ? 
9258 => yeah , i knew him , gannet responded . 
9259 => mr 
9260 => gannet , if you dont mind , id like to come down to tucson and speak with you in person . 
9261 => whatre you trying to get on palmer ? 
9262 => has he done anything ? 
9263 => no , mr 
9264 => gannet , he died recently , and im trying to put his life back together . 
9265 => hes dead ? 
9266 => oh , im sorry to hear that , gannet sounded sad . 
9267 => yeah , we were close friends once and i made the mistake of losing that friendship out of negligence . 
9268 => i guess im trying to make amends . 
9269 => and , a little late for that , wouldnt you say old friend of his , gannet added sternly . 
9270 => yes , i know . 
9271 => minnesota huh ? 
9272 => gannet sounded friendlier . 
9273 => got to be damn cold today . 
9274 => its a lot nicer here in tucson , im sure . 
9275 => are you a mind reader mr 
9276 => gannet ? 
9277 => call me ted , and mr 
9278 => anderson , it doesnt take a clairvoyant to suspect the reason you want to come here . 
9279 => i grew up in grand forks n 
9280 => dakota . 
9281 => you figured me out thats for sure , and call me manny . 
9282 => you a golfer ted ? 
9283 => i play some . 
9284 => * so the visit to see billys mother was a bust , huh ? 
9285 => cassey asked , sitting at the kitchen table eating hot soup . 
9286 => man , is she batty , manny answered , cradling a hot mug in his hands . 
9287 => shes convinced that billy tried to steal you from me , and that kris was a good kid . 
9288 => kris , that screw off , and talk about a druggy , cassey said . 
9289 => no shit ! 
9290 => shes convinced that billy was a terrible womanizer , and kris was a saint . 
9291 => i never really knew her , or his dad , billy didnt spend too much time there , cassey returned . 
9292 => they were nicey-nice to me , phony , made me uncomfortable . 
9293 => billys dad really pulled one on him once . 
9294 => billy had gotten his license and asked to use his mothers car so we could go to a show . 
9295 => he had made arrangements for saturday night and he was picking me up at seven . 
9296 => it was our first car date . 
9297 => for two years we had to walk everywhere . 
9298 => half an hour before billy was going to pick me up , his dad took the car . 
9299 => his dad never used that car , only his mother drove it . 
9300 => poor billy had to call and tell me we were back to walking . 
9301 => about a month later his dad asked billy if he wanted to use the car to take me out ? 
9302 => billy said okay , told his dad saturday night would be great . 
9303 => saturday night came and billys dad was at home , figuring to do the same thing , but he didnt realize billy had outsmarted him and never intended to use the car . 
9304 => we came and picked billy up before his dad pulled his stunt . 
9305 => man , was his father pissed . 
9306 => i couldnt believe a father could be such a jerk . 
9307 => they were okay to me when we were kids , manny said , but they sure werent pro billy . 
9308 => i realized that a long time ago . 
9309 => and talking to his mother this morning , youd think she was describing attila the hun . 
9310 => you wonder about people like that , what makes them tick ? 
9311 => then you realize youd have to spend time with them to find out , and all of a sudden the need to know is not so important anymore . 
9312 => manny , youre such a pragmatic , scatter brained , character . 
9313 => is that a compliment , or a hint ? 
9314 => its a praise darling . 
9315 => id hate to see you chance , any other manny might not be as interesting . 
9316 => im going to see donny out in utah . 
9317 => yeah , he told me . 
9318 => you dont want to go ? 
9319 => nah , hell be here with danny in three more weeks for the holidays . 
9320 => itll be great to see them both together again . 
9321 => yeah , im looking forward to everyone being together . 
9322 => we sure are lucky , all this billy stuff has made me realize how important a close , loving family can be . 
9323 => a simple little thing like being there for each other makes such a difference . 
9324 => i hope it will always be like that manny , cassey said , snuggling up to manny i couldnt imagine anything that could change it my love , manny said , holding her tight . 
9325 => i found a guy that billy worked for in tucson arizona . 
9326 => ted gannet , gannet construction , and hes agreed to meet with me . 
9327 => after donny , ill swing down and then back home for the holidays . 
9328 => nothing from mark tainer about timtown ? 
9329 => cassey questioned . 
9330 => nah , i guess hes too busy right now . 
9331 => curious , i mean , wasnt billy important to him ? 
9332 => cassey , hes got a business to run . 
9333 => he said he hasnt even got the time to write anything himself . 
9334 => he said he would get back to us after the holidays . 
9335 => chapter 17 cheryl crow was rocking on the juke box , singing about sunshine somewhere , while manny was sitting in a dimly lit restaurant . 
9336 => he was in the back of the establishment , and the patrons were mostly soldiers . 
9337 => there was anything but sunshine out the window . 
9338 => the mountains in the near distance were cut horizontally by a solid gray line of heavy clouds . 
9339 => manny was talking with one of the soldiers , a good looking blond boy . 
9340 => mom says you are on some sort of quest ? 
9341 => the soldier asked . 
9342 => did she say anything about it ? 
9343 => no , not much . 
9344 => just , youre trying to find out about a guy you both knew . 
9345 => yeah , billy palmer . 
9346 => who was he ? 
9347 => a guy we grew up with . 
9348 => he went to vietnam . 
9349 => did he get back ? 
9350 => yeah , but thats where his problems started . 
9351 => he did his thing , and we never appreciated him for it . 
9352 => what was he in ? 
9353 => the marines , he was a sniper . 
9354 => whoa , tough dude . 
9355 => you know about those guys ? 
9356 => oh yeah , around here we get the noise . 
9357 => you think youre tough , try that on for size , etc 
9358 => , things like that . 
9359 => theres a group of snipers here in camp , and i kind of know one of the guys because hes from minnesota , and weve talked . 
9360 => you should talk to him . 
9361 => i can check it out if you want ? 
9362 => you think theyd talk to me ? 
9363 => cant hurt to try . 
9364 => ill look him up tonight when i get back to base , and see what he says . 
9365 => id appreciate that . 
9366 => how they treating you here ? 
9367 => good , the training is intense , but i guess its for a reason . 
9368 => never know when we might need to be sharp . 
9369 => to protect our way of life , huh ? 
9370 => damn right pop , the other side doesnt believe in cheerleaders . 
9371 => can you imagine life without pretty girls in short skirts . 
9372 => no , i cant even begin to imagine that , manny said smiling , thinking back to his school days , and pretty cassey out there cheering everyone on . 
9373 => * the next morning manny was back in the same place , but this time in one of the booths toward the front , eating breakfast . 
9374 => however , this morning there is a little bit of sun shining outside , the solid overcast from the day before had dissipated , giving way to scattered clouds . 
9375 => his son donny walked through the door with another soldier and headed toward manny . 
9376 => this one is older . 
9377 => dad , this is the minnesota guy i told you about , staff sergeant baylor , donny said as they took the seat across from manny . 
9378 => he got interested when i mentioned you knew a marine sniper from vietnam . 
9379 => they idolize those guys . 
9380 => yes , sir , we do , sir . 
9381 => im staff sergeant baylor , special ops , nice to meet you . 
9382 => youre from red pine ? 
9383 => yes , manny anderson . 
9384 => manny shook his hand . 
9385 => the sergeant was a tall thin guy , but he looked in great shape , the muscles on his arms were impressive . 
9386 => my son tells me youre from minnesota too . 
9387 => from the big city , minneapolis , but i go hunting up in your neck of the woods , beautiful country . 
9388 => only in the summer , sergeant . 
9389 => mr 
9390 => anderson , minnesota is great anytime of the year , compared to some of the places we end up . 
9391 => i can imagine . 
9392 => donny tells me youre part of a sniper team . 
9393 => yes , sir , but we do many different things . 
9394 => donny told you why i wanted to speak to you ? 
9395 => sort of . 
9396 => youre looking for information about a vietnam vet , somebody you knew . 
9397 => yes . 
9398 => i dont know if i can help , but if i can , i certainly will . 
9399 => that was a long time ago and things are different now . 
9400 => donny tells me your friend was a marine ? 
9401 => yes , his name was billy palmer and he was in vietnam in sixty-six and sixty-seven . 
9402 => ive talked to some of the people that knew him there , and its quite a story . 
9403 => im sure it was , those guys were something . 
9404 => they operated by themselves mostlyvery little support , something we dont have to worry about . 
9405 => much of our doctrine was put together by those guys . 
9406 => did he make it back ? 
9407 => yes . 
9408 => id like to talk to him , if thats possible , next time im up near red pine . 
9409 => he died a month ago . 
9410 => oh , im sorry to hear that . 
9411 => those marine snipers were one tough bunch though . 
9412 => if the brass would have listened to them they might have won that war . 
9413 => really kicked some serious gook ass . 
9414 => thats what im finding out . 
9415 => it took a different kind of person to be a sniper then . 
9416 => what kind of person do they look for now ? 
9417 => independent , people that can think for themselves . 
9418 => oddly enough , the sort of personnel that make good special ops troops are not necessarily good military men . 
9419 => im finding that out too . 
9420 => apparently my friend didnt have much patience for military thinking , or discipline . 
9421 => small units like that dont rely on the chain of command . 
9422 => every guy is expected to be a leader , if and when it becomes necessary . 
9423 => how could i get access to billys military record , or is that legal ? 
9424 => yes , of course , i would be glad to do it for you . 
9425 => they encourage us to get involved , dig into the histories of our predecessors . 
9426 => i have the day off , give me any information you have and i will see what i can find . 
9427 => manny gave baylor billys social security number , billys military number and his birth date . 
9428 => is this enough for you ? 
9429 => yes , i think i can get what you need with this . 
9430 => * manny , donny , and baylor were sitting in a fancier place this time , and it was dark outside . 
9431 => i pulled billy palmers records , and you will definitely be interested in what they say , said baylor . 
9432 => this guy , your friend billy palmer , he was definitely a real marine . 
9433 => this is his first proficiency report , done after week four in boot camp . 
9434 => sergeant baylor handed manny the report . 
9435 => manny took the paper and began to read . 
9436 => private palmer , is quick to learn , but has no inclination to lead . 
9437 => he is willing , however , to assist in any and all endeavors placed upon his fellow recruits . 
9438 => private palmer is extremely intelligent , proficient , and savvy , figuring out how to make his boot camp training as easy as possible , but not jeopardizing anyone elses position . 
9439 => private palmer does push the limits , but only those that involve his own circumstances . 
9440 => he gets along well with others , not really caring about the attitude of others toward himself , whether pro or con , and does not get involved in any group dynamics . 
9441 => i would classify private palmer as a mildly introverted , extrovert who seeks his diversion on his own . 
9442 => after manny was finished and put the paper down , baylor picked up another one . 
9443 => this is a second proficiency report done after week six , after they had done the rifle range training . 
9444 => private palmer was lacking in enthusiasm and needed some discipline concerning the snapping in phase of rifle training , but exhibited extreme proficiency in the actual shooting , constantly scoring very high numbers . 
9445 => private palmer is not in the least intimidated by the rank structure and has no apparent insolence to it either . 
9446 => when manny was done with the second report , the sergeant spoke . 
9447 => this is exactly the kind of person they look for . 
9448 => one that can run his own show , but will get involved if it is necessary . 
9449 => a loner that is willing to participate . 
9450 => i can tell you that this friend of yours , this billy palmer is the sort of guy we modeled our tactics from . 
9451 => this report about billy , what did you call it ? 
9452 => a proficiency report , its the evaluation of a persons progress . 
9453 => this is fascinating . 
9454 => who wrote these ? 
9455 => theyre damn good . 
9456 => ah , lets see , these were done in boot , baylor said the guy was one of the dis , a gunnery sergeant mullens . 
9457 => this guy was just a drill sergeant , he seems quite intelligent ? 
9458 => what , you think just anybody is allowed to be a recruit training member ? 
9459 => baylor laughed . 
9460 => those guys are handpicked , just like the snipers . 
9461 => they end up there because they are good at what they do . 
9462 => if you want to see competence , you should spend a couple of hours aboard one of our aircraft carriers . 
9463 => oh man , pop , hes not kidding , donny cut in . 
9464 => we had a short detachment on the carl vincent . 
9465 => man those sailors are something . 
9466 => i was scared shitless up on that flight deck , so much going on , but it was just another day to them . 
9467 => yeah , it seems like the general public sees only the worst part of the military , baylor added . 
9468 => the big story generally comes along when something goes wrong , like vietnam . 
9469 => there the only part anyone saw was the mess . 
9470 => im still having trouble understanding why it got so convoluted , so out of control , donny said , shaking his head . 
9471 => i guess the politicians had free reign on that one , baylor stated . 
9472 => that sergeant , is a summation if ive ever heard one , manny said . 
9473 => ive personally known quite a few politicians , and i doubt if they could successfully run anything . 
9474 => they can never get beyond the reelection mentality . 
9475 => their decisions are not based on what effect theyll have , just on how many votes theyll win or lose . 
9476 => ill never understand politics , donny said . 
9477 => someone has to be there , to take the credit , manny laughed . 
9478 => what about the blame ? 
9479 => donny asked . 
9480 => oh , you wont see a politician within miles of that discussion , trust me on that one . 
9481 => manny turned to baylor . 
9482 => so sergeant , tell me what fascinates you so much about billy palmer and his cohorts ? 
9483 => well , sir , those guys had no radios , no way to summon support . 
9484 => they just went into the bush on hunting trips . 
9485 => some of them never came back , you know . 
9486 => now , we are always in contact with support , air , artillery , medical and rescue elements . 
9487 => those guys in vietnam , especially the marine units , went out entirely on their own , under no ones orders , i might add , and capture was not an option . 
9488 => what do you mean , without orders ? 
9489 => they operated without getting orders from any higher source . 
9490 => they did all this on their own . 
9491 => they decided when and where to go , all on their own . 
9492 => you mean they didnt have to go into the field ? 
9493 => correct , they could have probably spent that war in the rear , but didnt . 
9494 => bills partner told me they would snatch villagers to get to the rear . 
9495 => why did he say they did that ? 
9496 => sometimes , some officers would try to incorporate them into the field company operations , walk point , dig bunkers , stand guard , things like that , and the guys didnt like it so they would grab a villager and then escort them to the rear . 
9497 => i wouldnt have blamed them in the least . 
9498 => there is nothing worse for a specialist trained in covert operations to be subjected to the everyday mayhem the normal units operate under . 
9499 => many of the line companies want special ops personnel because of their expertise , but the special ops people dont relish what they consider the risky business of the ground troops . 
9500 => each entity considers the other to be crazy , or foolish , to this day . 
9501 => yeah , billys partner , mark tainer , told me billy was very good at knowing where he was . 
9502 => every line officer in the regiment knew that and wanted billy around . 
9503 => tainer told me billy was wounded three times , and every time it was with a large unit , theyd just walk into the shit . 
9504 => the last time got him sent home , knocked out of the game . 
9505 => its all in here , baylor said , handing manny billys records . 
9506 => find anything bad ? 
9507 => some incidences of insubordination , but thats to be expected . 
9508 => the command structure of the military would naturally come in conflict with a man like billy , but he did his job well , i can tell you that . 
9509 => chapter 18 mt . 
9510 => lemon was dappled in sun light , as manny stopped in front of gannet construction . 
9511 => tucson arizona was one of his favorite cities because it was a blend of the old spanish and the new technology looks . 
9512 => the surrounding mountains and desert always had a fresh clean look . 
9513 => this haven in the desert experienced more rain than was the norm for the desert southwest . 
9514 => manny entered and did not have to wait to see ted gannet . 
9515 => he was ushered into the mans office by a secretary and introduced himself . 
9516 => billy palmer , yeah i knew him , ted gannet volunteered without provocation . 
9517 => best damn equipment operator i ever had . 
9518 => i met him at the va hospital and we got to talking . 
9519 => he said he had run some equipment , somewhere , and he needed a job . 
9520 => i gave him a try and i wasnt disappointed . 
9521 => he did a hell of a job , the most dependable guy i ever had . 
9522 => he was real creative . 
9523 => we do a lot of golf course shaping and you need guys that can visualize . 
9524 => billy was real good at that . 
9525 => how long did he work for you ? 
9526 => manny asked . 
9527 => oh hell , must have been three , three and a half years . 
9528 => youre a friend right ? 
9529 => how did that come about ? 
9530 => we were friends , a long time ago . 
9531 => we were close when we were kids . 
9532 => whats the scoop ? 
9533 => what do you want to know about him for ? 
9534 => im sorry to hear hes dead . 
9535 => how long ago ? 
9536 => hes been dead for a month now . 
9537 => sorry to hear that , i liked the guy . 
9538 => whatre you doing snooping around his past ? 
9539 => did he do something or what ? 
9540 => no , i was a friend of his when we were kids , like i said . 
9541 => i sort of lost track of him , and after he died , i just became interested in his life . 
9542 => what , you writing a book or something ? 
9543 => i dont know , maybe , but billy was the one who wrote a couple of them , good ones too . 
9544 => no kidding ? 
9545 => i often wondered about that guy . 
9546 => he was really astute , but he said so little about himself , i never really knew much . 
9547 => he never said anything about his military service ? 
9548 => nah , i asked him a couple of times , but he wouldnt say . 
9549 => i figured it must have been a bad experience , so i didnt press it . 
9550 => you know anything about it ? 
9551 => manny opened his brief case and handed ted a copy of billys records . 
9552 => ted opened the records and started reading . 
9553 => ted read for five minutes , silent the whole time . 
9554 => he finally looked over the top of the papers , staring at manny for a moment . 
9555 => ill be damned this is all true ? 
9556 => yes , sir , every word has been verified . 
9557 => ive got someone that should see this , do you mind ? 
9558 => ted reached for the phone on his desk and pushed a button . 
9559 => is miller around anywhere close ? 
9560 => ted asked when the secretary answered . 
9561 => yes , mr 
9562 => gannet , he said he was going back to the yard . 
9563 => get him in here , right away . 
9564 => ted looked over at manny . 
9565 => miller , thats my main foreman . 
9566 => he didnt like palmer , claimed he was a coward . 
9567 => why would he think that ? 
9568 => oh , hes a dumb-ass redneck . 
9569 => he said bill was a pussy because he and a couple of the other guys took him out hunting , and bill didnt measure up to their lofty standards . 
9570 => i guess palmer wouldnt shoot bambi , or something like that . 
9571 => miller accused him of being scared and insinuated that bill was a coward in the military . 
9572 => those idiots were always harassing him . 
9573 => im sure they were just threatened . 
9574 => like i said , bill was real smart , and most of the guys in this business arent known for their brilliance . 
9575 => ive got some that arent much smarter than the fibrous food group . 
9576 => ted continued to read through the information . 
9577 => this is quite a record . 
9578 => i had no idea palmer was even a marine . 
9579 => from mannys position in the office he could see down a hall running to the secretarys desk and beyond to the front door . 
9580 => a big , rough , burley man in jeans , cowboy boots , and work shirt opened the front door and stepped through . 
9581 => the man continued on past the secretary and stepped into the office . 
9582 => whats up boss , sounded important ? 
9583 => the man looked over at manny and just nodded . 
9584 => got something here you might be interested in . 
9585 => brute miller , manny anderson . 
9586 => brutes a nickname he picked up somewhere , cant imagine where , ted chuckled , looking at manny . 
9587 => the two men simply nodded at each other because brute made no effort to go over to manny . 
9588 => manny here is an old friend of someone that worked here . 
9589 => i think youll remember this guy ? 
9590 => ted handed a paper to brute . 
9591 => brute looked at manny , warily , as he walked over to the couch against the other wall and sat down . 
9592 => after a few moments he asked , whats this supposed to be ? 
9593 => brute held up a sheet of paper . 
9594 => whats it look like ? 
9595 => ted responded . 
9596 => i dont know for sure , but it looks like some sort of commendation . 
9597 => somebody got a medal ; the silver star ? 
9598 => recognize the name ? 
9599 => corporal william perry palmer . 
9600 => dont recognize the brute got a frown on his face . 
9601 => the big man looked at ted , then he looked back at the paper in his hand , and then back at ted . 
9602 => a slow thought seemed to be developing in his head . 
9603 => is this william palmer the same guy that worked for us quite a while back , the dozer operator ? 
9604 => ah , um , what was his name , ah ? 
9605 => bill , ted said . 
9606 => yeah , that guy , the good golf course builder ? 
9607 => brute asked . 
9608 => the one and the same . 
9609 => cant be . 
9610 => that guy was a sissy . 
9611 => he would have crapped his pants , anything like this happened to him , brute stated , sure of himself . 
9612 => same guy , miller . 
9613 => like i said , manny here , hes an old friend of mr 
9614 => palmers . 
9615 => came here to find out how his old friend was treated . 
9616 => shit boss , i had no idea . 
9617 => brute looked to ted and then to manny , an apologetic look on his face . 
9618 => just sticking it to you a little , brute , ted said , looking at manny , with a smirk on his face . 
9619 => brute and i go round and round about judging people . 
9620 => hes good with all the schlocks we have to hire to run the machines and do the grunt work , but is short on recognizing sophistication when it comes along . 
9621 => aw shit boss , i cant help it . 
9622 => mosta them boys aint any smarter than the machines they run , brute whined . 
9623 => gotcha on this one though . 
9624 => damn sure did . 
9625 => this really the same guy , huh ? 
9626 => yup ! 
9627 => well , i was right about the military fucking with his head . 
9628 => i got the why and how a little mixed up though . 
9629 => brute looked at manny . 
9630 => hey mister , when you see billy tell him im real sorry , i had no idea . 
9631 => billys dead ! 
9632 => no shit , what happened ? 
9633 => brute did sound sincere . 
9634 => im not really sure , but i think it had something to do with his credibility , manny threw back at brute . 
9635 => ted gannet smirked again . 
9636 => what do you mean credibility ? 
9637 => brute asked , puzzled . 
9638 => whats that got to do with dying ? 
9639 => maybe billy got tired of living , maybe he got tired of being misjudged ? 
9640 => he offed himself ? 
9641 => brute asked . 
9642 => i dont know ? 
9643 => maybe he just didnt take care of himself properly . 
9644 => i think he probably got tired of all the misconceptions regarding who he really was . 
9645 => ted was listening intently , watching brute , as manny laid out the scenario . 
9646 => hey , its his own damn fault ! 
9647 => shit , the guy didnt say nothing about all this . 
9648 => brute flicked the paper , offering his own version of an apology . 
9649 => would you have believed him if he did ? 
9650 => manny asked . 
9651 => sure , of course . 
9652 => what ya think , id make fun of a hero . 
9653 => but , ill tell yeah , my old man was in korea , and that nam was nothing like what he had to go through . 
9654 => shit those pussies had it good compared to them guys back then . 
9655 => i would like you to read the citation there , out loud if you would ? 
9656 => manny asked . 
9657 => brute looked at ted . 
9658 => go ahead miller , itll show youre contrite . 
9659 => huh ? 
9660 => brute responded . 
9661 => just read the citation , ted said . 
9662 => if you say so boss . 
9663 => um , lets see , it says that , corporal william perry palmer and corporal markham joseph tainer , on june 13th , 1966 . 
9664 => brute was slow and deliberate with his commentary . 
9665 => did , after setting up a firing position overlooking the village of duc duc , in the provincial province of tam key , the country of south vietnam , witness the ambush of the third squad , 1st platoon , hotel company , 2nd battalion fifth marines . 
9666 => corporals palmer and tainer , under great risk to themselves , abandoned their secure position and came to the aid of the remaining members of the above mentioned platoon . 
9667 => the two corporals , members of the battalions scout/sniper squad , were operating in a two man team and still knowing that they were vastly outnumbered , did in fact , break up the attack and save the platoon from certain annihilation . 
9668 => corporal palmer was wounded in said action , but continued to harass the enemy , figured to number at least fifty nva , until support arrived . 
9669 => thats enough mr 
9670 => miller , manny said . 
9671 => i think you can get a reasonably good idea of what billy did . 
9672 => yeah , geez , he saved a few guys , all right . 
9673 => i knew he had been in the service , but i thought he was just some sort of psycho , wash out . 
9674 => geez , we never had any idea , huh boss ! 
9675 => no , i guess in our defense we were a little ignorant all right , ted commented . 
9676 => tough shit they put up with , but ill bet it still wasnt as bad as korea . 
9677 => my old man had some rough fuckin shit there , made him mean as hell . 
9678 => wouldve curled your toes , just hearing about it . 
9679 => im sure it did , ted returned . 
9680 => i cant figure it ? 
9681 => brute said . 
9682 => why didnt that guy stick up for himself ? 
9683 => shit , he acted like such a pussy . 
9684 => whatre we talking about ? 
9685 => ted laughed . 
9686 => if i remember right , he ran you down like a dog that one time we had the football game . 
9687 => ah boss , i told you he blind-sided me , i never saw it coming . 
9688 => oh yeah , thats right . 
9689 => say brute , hows the equipment list for that job down south coming ? 
9690 => we got everything we need ? 
9691 => looks like it , but i still think we should get a new loader for the separation plant . 
9692 => weve about used up the old 950 and itll start costing us real money any day now . 
9693 => i think youre probably right , ted said . 
9694 => make sure you get the deal you want though . 
9695 => gotcha boss , brute miller said as he got up and headed out of the office . 
9696 => good man , ted said nodding to the hallway . 
9697 => knows the business and how to handle the men . 
9698 => somebody like billy comes along though , and guys like brute just naturally get their backs up . 
9699 => its not his fault , the viet nam vets just got a bad rap , and people tend to go with the flow . 
9700 => you trying to rectify the injustice at a late date ? 
9701 => ted asked . 
9702 => you might say that . 
9703 => good luck ! 
9704 => with all the new dilemmas on our door step , i dont know how much success youre going to have getting people to cop to an old oversight . 
9705 => probably not much , unless i make it entertaining . 
9706 => how you going to do that ? 
9707 => im not sure , but im trying to get someone interested in a book that billy wrote . 
9708 => he wrote some good stuff , huh ? 
9709 => could i read it ? 
9710 => ill get a copy to you when its ready . 
9711 => say , uh , how come billy quit working for you ? 
9712 => union bullshit . 
9713 => we got a big job in california and it was union . 
9714 => the union over there wouldnt take any new members , so we couldnt put him on . 
9715 => it was a really big job , took everything we had and we didnt have anything else for him at the time . 
9716 => the union denied a decorated , disabled veteran his right to make a decent living ? 
9717 => manny questioned thats about the size of it . 
9718 => is there anything else you know about billy , anything you can think of ? 
9719 => manny asked . 
9720 => not off hand , but you might try talking to his wife . 
9721 => his wife ! 
9722 => manny sat up attentively . 
9723 => i didnt know he was ever married ? 
9724 => oh yeah , pretty thing . 
9725 => a real gorgeous lady , smart too . 
9726 => miller and the other guys are usually crude and rude around women , but not when lucy came around . 
9727 => then they got real courteous . 
9728 => i think she intimidated the hell out of them . 
9729 => she was from california , someplace around palm springs . 
9730 => they had a kid too , you know . 
9731 => a little girl about five or six . 
9732 => looked like her mother , the lucky thing . 
9733 => billy never mentioned any of this , manny said . 
9734 => i wonder what happened to them ? 
9735 => he came back home about five years ago and he was all by himself . 
9736 => thats strange , he sure loved them . 
9737 => it looked like he had a good relationship at the time , but you know how things can change . 
9738 => chapter 19 all right , okay , i found them ! 
9739 => manny shouted , sitting over the computer . 
9740 => found who ? 
9741 => cassey asked . 
9742 => billys wife and kid . 
9743 => billy was really married then ? 
9744 => yeah , and he has a daughter . 
9745 => when was this ? 
9746 => he was married in 1978 , and his daughter was born in 1980 . 
9747 => the last known address is san diego . 
9748 => not another trip ? 
9749 => manny , youre going overboard with this . 
9750 => i cant help it , its getting to be more and more interesting . 
9751 => well , at least use the darn phone , once in a while . 
9752 => people can tell their story just as well without you staring them down . 
9753 => you know im just looking for an excuse to get out of here . 
9754 => i cant take the cold anymore . 
9755 => why dont you come with me this time ? 
9756 => manny , ive got two committees on my butt this month so if i dont do it , it wont get done . 
9757 => youre just afraid to fly , admit it . 
9758 => okay , so it scares the hell out of me , so what ? 
9759 => you never used to be . 
9760 => we talked about it ; there are people that can help you with that . 
9761 => look manny , ever since penny got killed in that plane , i dont know , it just freaks me out to think about getting on one again . 
9762 => these people you keep telling me to go to , do they run alongside the plane making sure that the wings dont fall off ? 
9763 => oh , dont be silly . 
9764 => silly , you expect me to listen to someone trying to convince me that it is okay to fly , and planes still crash . 
9765 => what i need is for somebody to guarantee me that the planes wont ever crash again , ever , and then ill consider it . 
9766 => besides , i dont hate the winter , you know that . 
9767 => i know , you love the seasons . 
9768 => jealous ? 
9769 => i was back when i couldnt get away , but i still wouldnt mind you with me . 
9770 => oh , well have all that time together after the snow melts . 
9771 => besides , if you do die in a plane crash then therell be people around to say , i told you so . 
9772 => cassey stuck her tongue out at manny . 
9773 => have you talked to that tainer guy ? 
9774 => i havent heard anything back on the book we sent him . 
9775 => no , i told him to get in touch with you . 
9776 => hell call , when hes ready . 
9777 => he said that they were extremely busy and it takes a couple of years to get a book to the public , even if it is good . 
9778 => i guess they have a lot going at the time . 
9779 => well , im thinking of sending it to someone else , someone that has the time . 
9780 => boy , youre impatient , you sound like this is your book , manny laughed . 
9781 => i know , but in a way it is . 
9782 => i want to see billy get his just reward for what he did . 
9783 => are you getting emotionally involved ? 
9784 => you bet your ass . 
9785 => the more i find out , the more i want to see it through . 
9786 => i guess the book turned into my baby . 
9787 => im just wondering why this mark is not taking an interest in billys work ? 
9788 => like i said , im thinking of maybe contacting another publisher . 
9789 => cassey , if you think thats what you want to do , go ahead . 
9790 => it wouldnt hurt to have a second opinion , never does . 
9791 => * yes , lucy guterraz , lucy palmer , is my daughter . 
9792 => the old man blinked , looking out into the much brighter light , his deeply lined , ancient looking face and head the only thing manny could see of him . 
9793 => manny could see the blinds were mostly drawn , the house very dark behind the partially open door . 
9794 => lucy was my daughter , the old man added sadly . 
9795 => the house manny came to was an old , post wwii design , so familiar to this san diego neighborhood . 
9796 => it was well kept , the yard clean , the grass neatly cut . 
9797 => a large shady tree in the front yard cut off the direct sunlight to the front porch , where manny was standing . 
9798 => the house and street would be unremarkable , except that looking down the street , manny could see the sparkling blue of the pacific ocean . 
9799 => was ? 
9800 => oh no , manny hesitated , the comment catching him off guard . 
9801 => im sorry , i , a , im not sure what to say . 
9802 => do you mean shes dead ? 
9803 => mannys voice betrayed his shock and sadness . 
9804 => he had been very excited about finding billys wife . 
9805 => yes , the man said morosely . 
9806 => he was very old and frail , holding on to the partially open door for support . 
9807 => im sorry . 
9808 => i had no idea she was dead , manny stammered , uncertain how to continue , or maybe duck out . 
9809 => i am so sorry to trouble you , but i was once a close friend of billy palmers . 
9810 => i am at the right place ? 
9811 => a sad little smile appeared on the dated face . 
9812 => yes , i know billy . 
9813 => he was married to my daughter for almost ten years . 
9814 => ah , i dont know how to continue here , could i come in ? 
9815 => i just want to find out about billy , anything you could tell me ? 
9816 => its such a nice day out , i could come out if you wish ? 
9817 => the old man said . 
9818 => its so dreary in the house . 
9819 => the old man fully opened the door , waiting for manny to agree to his request . 
9820 => by all means , im just in from minnesota , and its great to feel warm weather , manny said agreeably the old man stepped on to the porch and pointed to a couple of chairs . 
9821 => please sit down mr 
9822 => . 
9823 => . 
9824 => ? 
9825 => anderson , but just manny , if you dont mind . 
9826 => nice to meet you manny . 
9827 => im wendell . 
9828 => funny name for a mexican , huh ? 
9829 => wendell said , hobbling to one chair . 
9830 => but my family has been here for generations . 
9831 => your friend billy was a very good man . 
9832 => i have missed him , but after what happened to my lucy , he couldnt get past it and he , he never came back . 
9833 => he would call from time to time , but he never came back to this street . 
9834 => he is dead , right ? 
9835 => yes , how did you know ? 
9836 => billy was a dead man for many years , in his spirit , wendell said with a deep sigh . 
9837 => i had a premonition a while ago that his body had finally joined his soul . 
9838 => you know , some people say i am a strange old man , but if i try hard enough , i can see my lucy playing in the street , right out there . 
9839 => the old man pointed to the street . 
9840 => i can really see her . 
9841 => sometimes i can see billy sitting there . 
9842 => the old man pointed to the love seat at the far end of the porch . 
9843 => i can see billy with lucy sitting on his lap , laughing , enjoying each other . 
9844 => they were meant to be together . 
9845 => he loved his wife then ? 
9846 => manny asked . 
9847 => oh yes , and jasmine , wendell perked up , oh , the dear sweet little girl . 
9848 => he looked out to the street and sat still not speaking . 
9849 => they are both dead now , for eight years , he finally said , his voice quavering . 
9850 => my god , i didnt mean to just show up on your door step and rehash something so obviously painful for you , manny apologized profusely . 
9851 => i am so sorry . 
9852 => but , manny , it is good to talk about the saints you have known , wendell countered . 
9853 => it does an old man good to discuss the bright times in his twilight years . 
9854 => what happened ? 
9855 => manny asked . 
9856 => lucy was murdered , and little jasmine too . 
9857 => an evil man , high on drugs broke into their apartment when lucy and jasmine were there , alone . 
9858 => they never figured out if this man didnt know anyone was home , or just didnt care , because he was surely out of his mind . 
9859 => killed them both , a mother and her daughter for less than sixty dollars . 
9860 => jesus , no wonder billy was so elusive the last time i saw him . 
9861 => how could anyone function after something like that ? 
9862 => manny exclaimed . 
9863 => no wonder he looked beaten , really down . 
9864 => i was shocked , i never thought billy could be so subdued , and now i know why . 
9865 => yes , he did blame himself for not being there . 
9866 => at first i was worried that he would go after this evil man , this el diablo , but billy said that it would not bring them back . 
9867 => i am not a violent man , but when i saw what it did to him , i changed my mind . 
9868 => i told billy that to save his spirit , he maybe should taste the revenge , but he said no , that the laws were meant for everybody . 
9869 => you want to hear the saddest part of this tragedy ? 
9870 => wendell continued . 
9871 => this evil man that killed a mother and her daughter , my family , was supposed to be a viet nam veteran , just like billy palmer . 
9872 => this man was on full disability , claiming that his flash-backs prevented him from holding a job . 
9873 => before he gets to trial , he pleads guilty by reason of insanity . 
9874 => the well-meaning states attorney takes the plea , and they send this man to a mental hospital , based on his va evaluation , which says that he is mentally unstable because of his war experience . 
9875 => meanwhile , the detective assigned to the case is reading a book called stolen valor , are you familiar with it manny ? 
9876 => yes , i know the book . 
9877 => yes , i dont have to explain it then . 
9878 => this detective decides to check this man out and he finds this man , eddy crane , has never been in vietnam . 
9879 => this man has never even been in the service . 
9880 => this man has lied about everything . 
9881 => the va would not admit their mistake , officially , and this man continues to get his full disability . 
9882 => it is a very confusing system we have manny . 
9883 => you cant make much sense to a bureaucrat . 
9884 => i was with the diplomatic corps for many years , manny . 
9885 => i came to realize that politics is a very flawed form of governing , that is for sure . 
9886 => but , it gets even worse manny . 
9887 => after six years , the state doctors say this evil man is all better and can go home , with his full disability of course . 
9888 => of course , manny said . 
9889 => the only vindication in this saga is that the man hasnt killed anyone else . 
9890 => at least , not as far as we know . 
9891 => who is this guy ? 
9892 => do you know where he is now ? 
9893 => yes , i think so . 
9894 => the detective keeps track of him the best he can , but it is difficult . 
9895 => the authorities say they cant give this information out . 
9896 => they must protect his identity and location , you know , for his safety . 
9897 => i can never forget him . 
9898 => i am an old man , manny , and i dont have long to live , but if someone younger could take up my cause ? 
9899 => oh , im sorry mr 
9900 => guterraz , i know youre very angry and rightfully so , but im not the sort of person to take up a vendetta . 
9901 => i have a family of my own . 
9902 => oh no manny , billy was right of course , but i would like to see this man at least be deprived of his ill-gotten gains , that is all . 
9903 => mr 
9904 => guterraz , i dont know what i can do ? 
9905 => im just a business man and i have no expertise for that sort of thing . 
9906 => i stay as far away from officialdom as i can because they frustrate the hell out of me . 
9907 => yes , i understand manny . 
9908 => wendell looked out to the street with a vacant look . 
9909 => it was wrong of me to infer manny detected a faint smile forming on mr 
9910 => gutterazs face , his attention still focused on the street . 
9911 => poor old man , his memories are all that keep him going . 
9912 => manny watched the old man , thinking of how to extract himself from the situation . 
9913 => i feel so bad for this old guy , i hate to just up and leave . 
9914 => a very faint sound from the street caused manny to shift his gaze , looking under the tree , out to the blacktop . 
9915 => i thought i might have heard children playing , but theres no one there . 
9916 => the old man chuckled , causing manny to look back at him . 
9917 => mr 
9918 => guterraz had a broad smile on his face and a sparkle in his eyes . 
9919 => i heard it again , children out there , playing . 
9920 => manny looked intently to where he thought the children should be . 
9921 => but , theres no one there . 
9922 => do you hear them ? 
9923 => mr 
9924 => guterraz asked . 
9925 => who ? 
9926 => manny asked , slightly spooked . 
9927 => whats happening here ? 
9928 => there , in the street , my daughter and her child , they are there . 
9929 => mr 
9930 => guterraz pointed out under the tree . 
9931 => they want you to see how beautiful they were . 
9932 => they know you were a friend of billys and they want you to see them . 
9933 => look , manny , look hard and you will . 
9934 => this crazy old coot is batty for christ sakes . 
9935 => hes scaring the shit out of me . 
9936 => listen manny , do you hear them ? 
9937 => them , i cant believe thi manny sat up suddenly , straightening in his seat . 
9938 => there manny , there , they want you to see them . 
9939 => the old mans voice was soothing and mesmerizing . 
9940 => manny stared intently , listening . 
9941 => somethings out there , i can hear so . 
9942 => my god , thats got to be just the heat ! 
9943 => manny exclaimed , staring at the street , watching something . 
9944 => no manny anderson , that is billys wife and child . 
9945 => he would want you to do this for him . 
9946 => the man to see is detective sergeant albright . 
9947 => he has an office downtown , ill get his number . 
9948 => * manny left wendell guterrazs humble home , shook up . 
9949 => at first , driving in the rental car , he tried and tried to dispel what had happened . 
9950 => his first line of defense was his reputation for being realistic . 
9951 => he was a sagittarius and although he personally dismissed most of the heavy sales pitch attached to the practice of astrology , he did use the personality traits of his sign to his advantage . 
9952 => it was easy and convenient to attribute his aloofness and individualistic qualities to his sign , without having to explain his actions . 
9953 => being a sagittarius , being the explorer , complimented his mystic . 
9954 => cassey knew what he was up to , and that made it all the easier . 
9955 => manny was a realist and as hard as he tried to pass the incident with wendell off as unexplainable , or the product of a tired , over imaginative mind , he kept coming back to the fact that he had been there , and he had witnessed something very strange . 
9956 => wendell either enticed me to see what he wanted , or there really was a phenomenon in that street . 
9957 => after driving around aimlessly for nearly an hour , manny found himself cruising slowly along a street next to the ship channel leading from the port of san diego to the pacific ocean . 
9958 => it was getting dark and the fog was rolling in , advancing from seaward . 
9959 => manny parked the car and got out , breathing in the salty , damp air . 
9960 => the moisture laden atmosphere quickly surrounded him , the entire car already coated with a thick , wet layer of condensation . 
9961 => so many different places in this world . 
9962 => manny took in a deep breath . 
9963 => all this water , but it doesnt smell like any lake and im used to that . 
9964 => manny walked toward the ship channel . 
9965 => he could hear the buoy bells clanging , but could barely see some lights out over the water . 
9966 => by the time he had gotten as far as the side walk running along the channel , only smell and sound remained , the fog was so thick . 
9967 => guterraz you old bugger , what happened back there ? 
9968 => did you do something to me or was it real ? 
9969 => i should be angry or scared , but im not . 
9970 => you set me up you old shit , and now i have to find out . 
9971 => manny stood motionless , many thoughts going through his head . 
9972 => in the jungle its so dark you cant see a thing so your eyes are worthless , so you must use the other senses . 
9973 => it is not the kind of situation that you can afford to be out of touch with your surroundings . 
9974 => tainers words suddenly popped into his head . 
9975 => * at five the next morning , manny was standing in the same spot , having spent a restless night in his hotel room . 
9976 => the fog was still there , as heavy as it had been when he left the night before . 
9977 => he had been memorizing the sounds and the locations and now they were familiar to him . 
9978 => he stood quietly analyzing each sound , forming a picture in his mind . 
9979 => as it began to get light he strained to see , but the fog still shrouded everything . 
9980 => his first visual were the rocks running from the sidewalk down into the mist toward the sound of the lapping water . 
9981 => patience , manny , patience . 
9982 => a small black object between two rocks was a blob , indefinable , until it moved . 
9983 => when it did , it became a crab . 
9984 => the colorless , pulpy substance near it became seaweed , long after manny had first smelled it . 
9985 => it was minutes before the water gurgling in between the rocks was recognizable , but as it did , manny already had an image in his head and knew what to expect . 
9986 => the sound of the waves farther out were no surprise , they looked just as they had sounded . 
9987 => each object , moving farther and farther out from him , a buoy bell , a small ship heading out to sea , only the running lights showing . 
9988 => then a much larger ship that he could hear pushing through the water , he knew what they would look like before he could see them . 
9989 => as they came into view , the sky was getting lighter and the fog thinning . 
9990 => manny , for the first time in his life was getting familiar with his surroundings . 
9991 => he had become one with this little part of the world . 
9992 => then he realized he had experienced the calmness , the confidence , the thrill before . 
9993 => occasionally , when everything was gelling , everything clicking , everything going his way ; he felt this on the golf course . 
9994 => manny never before surmised exactly why he loved the game so much . 
9995 => thank you wendell , i owe you one . 
9996 => * manny drove from the ship channel into downtown san diego with a calm determination . 
9997 => manny was at the police station early and waiting for detective albright as he arrived . 
9998 => the desk sergeant indicated manny to the detective and albright walked over . 
9999 => what can i do for you first thing in the morning ? 
10000 => the detective asked , somewhat suspicious . 
10001 => you were an investigator in the palmer homicides , a few years back ? 
10002 => one of them , whats your interest ? 
10003 => billy palmer , the father , was a friend of mine . 
10004 => rough deal , he ever get over it ? 
10005 => i dont know , he never mentioned it . 
10006 => he died a month ago , and im taking up the cause . 
10007 => boy , do i sound pushy . 
10008 => and , what cause is that ? 
10009 => the man that murdered his family was a fraud . 
10010 => most murderers can fit that bill . 
10011 => this eddy crane , was , is getting vet benefits , illegally . 
10012 => not according to the va , hes not , illegally , i mean . 
10013 => they bought his story hook line and sinker . 
10014 => who told you all this ? 
10015 => mr 
10016 => guterraz . 
10017 => nice man , how is he doing ? 
10018 => hes doing , but he misses his daughter and granddaughter . 
10019 => not much left that late in life . 
10020 => too late to start over when it comes to a family . 
10021 => yeah , i guess it would be . 
10022 => you investigated mr 
10023 => cranes service record and found none . 
10024 => im not at liberty to discuss the matter . 
10025 => whys that ? 
10026 => were a government agency , same as the va 
10027 => look , detective , i know you tried to do something concerning mr 
10028 => crane ; and i can surely realize it wouldnt be difficult for one segment of the government to make it difficult for another segment , to make waves . 
10029 => you understand a lot mr 
10030 => . 
10031 => . 
10032 => ? 
10033 => anderson , manny . 
10034 => well , understand this manny . 
10035 => i was sick when i found out about it all , and i was going to do something about this fraudulent pension , but i was instructed to drop the case . 
10036 => it was over , the man was sentenced , and the file was closed . 
10037 => i understand , makes sense to me . 
10038 => give me the information i need and i will pick up where you left off . 
10039 => impossible . 
10040 => nothing is impossible . 
10041 => there are certain things that need to be done , and i will see this accomplished , with or without your help . 
10042 => i was hoping there would be some satisfaction for you in knowing that i was so determined . 
10043 => believe me detective albright , it will get done . 
10044 => im staying at the downtown radisson , room four-one-eight . 
10045 => thank you for your time detective . 
10046 => you know that nice old man is getting you to do this for him ? 
10047 => i do things of my own accord . 
10048 => my colleague thinks mr 
10049 => guterraz is a warlock . 
10050 => he can make people see things . 
10051 => what did he get you to see , mr 
10052 => anderson ? 
10053 => the need to do something , was all manny said as he turned away from the detective . 
10054 => manny didnt want the cop to see the cold sweat and shivers that had overcome him from the detectives comment about wendells control . 
10055 => manny had a message waiting for him when he returned to the hotel . 
10056 => it had an address for yuma , arizona and nothing more . 
10057 => chapter 20 manny rented another car and drove east from san diego , arriving in yuma just as the sun was setting . 
10058 => hopefully the detective gave manny the location of eddy crane . 
10059 => manny was surprised as he sat in the rental car , parked next to a school , looking at the house supposedly owned by eddy crane . 
10060 => it was a surprise that a multiple murder should be able to reside in such a nice neighborhood , and be able to live in a fine house like the one he was looking at . 
10061 => my god , how some people manage to come out smelling like roses no matter what they do . 
10062 => i guess , being housed and fed for seven years , while on the full dole , adds up , manny said to himself , disgusted . 
10063 => manny sat in the car for half an hour , mostly watching the beautiful desert twilight . 
10064 => when it was fully dark he started the car and drove off , deciding to get a motel and some sleep . 
10065 => he wasnt sure what hed do in the morning . 
10066 => * at first light , manny was back at the address , this time driving past the crane residence . 
10067 => the garage door was up , and he saw a dark pickup inside . 
10068 => well , bingo ! 
10069 => manny said to himself because the name on the mail box said e 
10070 => crane . 
10071 => manny drove by the house and went down the street , a ways , and was turning around when he saw the pickup back out of the garage and into the street . 
10072 => manny hurriedly drove up behind the truck and honked . 
10073 => are you edward crane ? 
10074 => he asked as he pulled alongside , his drivers side window next to the open passenger window of the truck . 
10075 => whos asking ? 
10076 => edward crane was old and mean looking , dressed in dirty unkept clothes . 
10077 => its hard to tell his physical stature sitting there in the truck , but the hands are skinny and weak looking . 
10078 => i am ! 
10079 => manny announced . 
10080 => the frailty of this man doesnt seem the least bit intimidating to me . 
10081 => leave me alone ! 
10082 => then i assume that you are edward crane ? 
10083 => assuming the wrong thing can get you in trouble mister ! 
10084 => is that a threat ? 
10085 => leave me alone mister . 
10086 => im not going to tell you again ! 
10087 => crane said , starting to reach under the seat of the truck . 
10088 => i would assume ; someone with your record would not consider having a gun under that seat . 
10089 => talk about trouble ! 
10090 => manny surprised himself . 
10091 => he wasnt sure if it was seeing just an old man , or the things this guy had done that was driving him to be so bold , but it was working . 
10092 => eddy crane sat up straight , putting both hands back on the steering wheel . 
10093 => now , im looking for edward crane , im interested in his story . 
10094 => what story would that be ? 
10095 => ive heard the edward crane im looking for is a highly decorated veteran . 
10096 => that he was dealt some injustices in his life , that same edward crane . 
10097 => i served my country with valor , and they took no responsibility for what they did to me . 
10098 => this guy has some balls , either that , or hes been lying so long he really believes it . 
10099 => if thats what youre wondering ? 
10100 => crane continued , taking the bait . 
10101 => then you might be the edward crane im looking for ? 
10102 => might be , might not . 
10103 => what have you got for the right edward crane ? 
10104 => a chance to hear his story told correctly , and maybe some monetary gain . 
10105 => you got a drivers license , something to tell me who you are ? 
10106 => manny hesitated , not wanting this man to know who he was , where he lived . 
10107 => i should have planned this out better , but ive got cranes ear , and i dont want to lose this opportunity . 
10108 => manny took out his drivers license and handed it to crane through the window of the pickup . 
10109 => i think it is a shame the way the returning vets were treated , manny said quickly , while reaching out for his license back . 
10110 => i think they should be compensated , as much as possible , dont you ? 
10111 => he stated , as crane gave him the license back . 
10112 => manny was relieved because crane didnt seem to look at the license long , just matching manny to the photo . 
10113 => that war was really terrible for me , crane whined . 
10114 => mannys spine shivered because crane sounded like a spoiled little girl . 
10115 => i cant get over what they made me do . 
10116 => i had to do a lot of killing . 
10117 => it was real hard on me . 
10118 => i havent been right since then . 
10119 => cant sleep right , its just terrible what they made me do . 
10120 => i cant get over the babies i had to kill . 
10121 => i remember this one little girl , it was so awful . 
10122 => i suppose you know about my problems , but none of it was my fault after what i had to do . 
10123 => they owe me . 
10124 => yes , mr 
10125 => crane , i dont doubt you deserve something far different than what youre getting now . 
10126 => good day , ill be in touch . 
10127 => manny stepped down hard on the accelerator , wanting to put distance between himself and this disgusting man . 
10128 => chapter 21 manny was at the computer working diligently , when cassey entered the room . 
10129 => whats got your total attention , ive never seen you work so hard ? 
10130 => cassey asked . 
10131 => im working on a letter to the va . 
10132 => i just got off the phone with senator blake . 
10133 => i informed him off the discrepancy regarding this edward cranes disability claim . 
10134 => manny , isnt this getting a little overboard ? 
10135 => this guy murdered billys wife and daughter . 
10136 => but you might be getting too involved , dont you think ? 
10137 => besides , you said this guy was a nut . 
10138 => do you really want him in your life ? 
10139 => hes not going to be in my life , i just want to right a wrong . 
10140 => things have a way of happening , anderson , cassey lectured . 
10141 => i just think you should leave well enough alone . 
10142 => the guy killed billys wife and kid . 
10143 => you already said that ! 
10144 => i dont see what this is going to accomplish for billy ? 
10145 => lucys father told me this guy was , and still is , collecting full disability payments from the va , and was never even in the service . 
10146 => manny , how can that be ? 
10147 => remember that book i wanted you to read , the stolen valor one . 
10148 => i read a little . 
10149 => it was boring and i couldnt finish . 
10150 => but you got the gist of it , right ? 
10151 => i guess , but there are a lot of books on this theory or that . 
10152 => doesnt mean that they have any validity . 
10153 => lucys father gave me the name of the detective that worked the case and he verifies that this guy , edward crane , was never in the service . 
10154 => this guys lawyer got him off with an insanity plea using his va records which classified him as suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome , brought on by his service in vietnam , which the va refuses to acknowledge never happened . 
10155 => i want the va to correct the issue . 
10156 => manny , this guy kills people , and you are going to do what to him ? 
10157 => we pay taxes , and ill be damned if i am going to stand by and see this sort of injustice . 
10158 => damnit , this lying sack of shit destroyed billys happiness , and then uses the very system that was put in place to help guys like billy . 
10159 => its an injustice of unparalleled magnitude , and im going to do something about it . 
10160 => i thought it was supposed to be us that did the horrible thing to billy ? 
10161 => now youve conveniently found someone else to pass the blame to . 
10162 => this billy escapade youve take on , dont you think it might be moving into the excessive stage ? 
10163 => you might want to consider that , cassey scolded . 
10164 => also consider , this guy is dangerous , and youre talking about screwing him , big time . 
10165 => i dont know manny , i thought this was a harmless diversion for you , but its taking on a life of its own . 
10166 => i dont want my life complicated . 
10167 => im really quite happy , you know . 
10168 => dont ruin that for me manny . 
10169 => i will never forgive you , i promise . 
10170 => im going to be careful cassey . 
10171 => i just need to do this . 
10172 => i dont want this sort of thing happening , and no one doing a thing about it . 
10173 => why doesnt this father do anything , it was his daughter and granddaughter ? 
10174 => hes old and tired and losing his family did him in . 
10175 => he had very nice things to say about billy , really misses him . 
10176 => billy stayed in touch with him ? 
10177 => i guess , sporadically , but according to mr 
10178 => guterraz , thats the father , billy and his daughter had a good relationship and cared deeply for each other . 
10179 => wendell says that the life went out of billy when she was murdered . 
10180 => remember , he lost his little girl too and i guess he was very close to her . 
10181 => jennifer was her name , heres a picture of them both . 
10182 => manny took a photo he had in with his papers and handed it to cassey . 
10183 => cassey took the photo and looked at it for a long time . 
10184 => why did you do this to me ? 
10185 => cassey finally said , sounding very sad . 
10186 => do what ? 
10187 => manny asked , looking up from the computer . 
10188 => emotionally blindsided me with this ? 
10189 => cassey said , holding out the picture , still looking at it . 
10190 => i dont get what youre saying ? 
10191 => i dont know how to explain it , i , uh , i just cant explain it . 
10192 => this picture is so profoundly sad . 
10193 => not the picture , i mean . 
10194 => its a beautiful picture . 
10195 => cassey looked intently at the photo . 
10196 => these are two beautiful people . 
10197 => cassey pointed to the photo . 
10198 => but theyre dead . 
10199 => cassey said nothing , just stared at the photo , silently . 
10200 => after about a minute , she said with reverence . 
10201 => and i never got to meet them . 
10202 => its a powerful picture , isnt it ? 
10203 => its just a picture of a beautiful woman and her daughter , why does it pull at me so ? 
10204 => i means that billy had his good times , even after we shunned his friendship . 
10205 => he went on his way and found happiness without us . 
10206 => is that it ? 
10207 => do you really think so manny ? 
10208 => here we are working on this massive guilt trip , and it turns out it wasnt necessary ? 
10209 => heres proof that billy probably just got tired of us and our silliness and went his way . 
10210 => i sort of got the same feeling as i read that story of his . 
10211 => he didnt need us or our silly shit . 
10212 => we didnt deal him a crappy hand that mattered . 
10213 => we just didnt realize the depth of billy , and were the ones that lost ? 
10214 => my god cassey , do you think we might be approaching maturity ? 
10215 => manny , if that happens , who will we associate with ? 
10216 => cassey laughed . 
10217 => what did the senator say ? 
10218 => he wants confirmation . 
10219 => says if he gets it , our man crane will be looking for work . 
10220 => hes a bad man manny , i just cant get past that thought . 
10221 => theres no way he can find us , manny stated , but he was uncomfortable with the statement . 
10222 => * on the radio the weather forecaster was saying , it looked like the central portion of minnesota can expect a balmy day . 
10223 => balmy , balmy for late december in minnesota , what a smuck . 
10224 => poor dumb asses that get stuck here all winter might go for it . 
10225 => partly sunny with highs in the mid-thirties , but look out for tomorrow ladies and gents , the cheerful voice on the radio continued , its back to the winter were all accustomed too . 
10226 => a cold front is moving down from our neighbor to the north and we can expect snow and cold by tomorrow . 
10227 => now thats more like it . 
10228 => manny was in the kitchen getting coffee . 
10229 => it was still dark outside , but he was up , his mind on overdrive . 
10230 => it looks like we will have that customary white , white christmas , ended the weatherman , christmas music replacing him . 
10231 => no shit , sherlock ! 
10232 => the white , white is piled higher than my ass out there , manny said , looking out the kitchen window . 
10233 => he could see the first light of morning through the bare trees at the end of the yard . 
10234 => the ringing phone made him turn away . 
10235 => hello , north pole , if youre looking for santa , he quit and went to florida , manny answered . 
10236 => are you still a smart ass in the summer , or are there other things to occupy that troubled mind ? 
10237 => the voice on the other end replied . 
10238 => always troubled , but busier , less focused . 
10239 => this sounds like a publisher i know . 
10240 => whats your excuse for getting me out of bed ? 
10241 => it must be warm in there , what are you complaining about ? 
10242 => you wouldnt believe it tainer , high of thirty-five on the glacier today . 
10243 => well , there you go , youve got nothing to bitch about . 
10244 => cold and snow tomorrow , whats up ? 
10245 => your wife called me yesterday , but i was sorry to inform her that i havent really had the time to get into the book you sent me . 
10246 => one of my readers said that there might be something there , but these things take time . 
10247 => we need to be realistic , tell her that , will you . 
10248 => cassey can be a determined bugger when she gets into something and it can be hard to head her off . 
10249 => just tell her to be patient , give me a little time , okay . 
10250 => look , im calling to invite you to new york , on my dime . 
10251 => when we talking about ? 
10252 => i just got back from california and arizona . 
10253 => tomorrow , if possible . 
10254 => i know with the holidays coming up it might be squeezing things , but i really would like to sit down with you and talk about billy . 
10255 => i thought you were too busy to work on billys things ? 
10256 => i want to talk about palmer , not his writing , can you make it ? 
10257 => i guess , but it should only be a day or two . 
10258 => i have to look like im trying to enjoy the holidays and i have to be close to home to pull that off . 
10259 => i understand . 
10260 => you come in tomorrow and out the next day , hows that ? 
10261 => i guess i can get away with it . 
10262 => good , minneapolis , northwest tomorrow evening , flight 213 , 7:45 p.m 
10263 => , can you pull that off . 
10264 => yeah , its about three hours from here to the airport , so no problemo . 
10265 => * jesus manny , cassey whined . 
10266 => another trip ? 
10267 => you just got back . 
10268 => where to now ? 
10269 => just a short trip to new york , some business to take care of before the holidays . 
10270 => im going and coming , short trip , i promise . 
10271 => well , it better be short because ive got a ton of things to do . 
10272 => you know this is the first family christmas in three years . 
10273 => both the boys will be here , and i dont know when that will happen again . 
10274 => cassey , i promise , ill be back thursday night . 
10275 => there is no way im staying any longer than a day . 
10276 => you going to see mark tainer ? 
10277 => i dont know . 
10278 => he was uncertain why he had to lie about his real reason . 
10279 => he wasnt doing anything wrong , but he didnt want cassey getting mad , accusing him about being obsessed with billy palmer after her dressing him down about crane . 
10280 => i might give him a call . 
10281 => well , tell him to poop or get off the pot . 
10282 => now cassey , hes a busy man . 
10283 => im sure when hes ready , or has something , youll be the first to know . 
10284 => i talked to caroline jennings , her daughter had that book published , remember ? 
10285 => cassey didnt continue . 
10286 => and ? 
10287 => manny knew his cue . 
10288 => and mattie said we might be able to talk to her publisher , after the holidays . 
10289 => hey , do what you want , youre the one thats done all the work . 
10290 => chapter 22 new york citys weather didnt look much better than what he left in minnesota , manny decided , looking out the window of mark tainer 's office . 
10291 => im sorry about not having anything to tell cassey about the book , i hope you understand that it takes time , mark was saying . 
10292 => no , dont worry , i understand . 
10293 => cassey isnt business minded . 
10294 => she can get impatient , and like i said , it can be hard to distract her sometimes . 
10295 => shes contacting some other publishers . 
10296 => what ? 
10297 => tainer exclaimed , obviously excited . 
10298 => dont do that , i want this material ! 
10299 => well , i just figured that being as busy as you say , you wouldnt mind . 
10300 => i dont like people playing politics with me , tainer stated , obviously angry . 
10301 => i dont understand what you mean by playing politics ? 
10302 => using pressure on me . 
10303 => what pressure ? 
10304 => geez man , cassey just figured ; if youre so busy she would take a load off you by talking to someone else . 
10305 => when did she do this ? 
10306 => tainer asked quickly . 
10307 => she hasnt done anything yet . 
10308 => manny held his hands up trying to calm tainer . 
10309 => we just talked about it , and with the holidays around the corner it was something she was going to get to after the first of the year , but i am curious ; if you havent read billys stuff , why the excitement about it going somewhere else ? 
10310 => manny , i know its good , my reader verified that , but it takes a long time . 
10311 => billy was my buddy and i better than anyone should do this . 
10312 => im very interested with doing something about billy . 
10313 => ive always wanted to write the great story , but never had the time , or until now , the material . 
10314 => but youve always known the story , you were there with him . 
10315 => manny , the total story of billy . 
10316 => thats why i invited you here , to pick your brain on palmer , to piece his life together . 
10317 => oh , the whole thing . 
10318 => i get it now . 
10319 => thats why you want funny stuff i remembered about billy . 
10320 => yes , billy was a verifiable hero , but war stories about heroes tell so little about how that hero came to be and what happened after . 
10321 => i want to do a complete story . 
10322 => ahhhh , well let me think . 
10323 => there was so much its hard to just off the top of your head ? 
10324 => manny thought for a moment . 
10325 => one time we were in a restaurant down at the lake . 
10326 => it was sunday morning and the place was full of people coming from church . 
10327 => we had been at the lake water skiing and went to get something to eat . 
10328 => it was billy , cassey , and my girlfriend at the time . 
10329 => we were waiting in line , and for some reason i decided to play a joke on billy . 
10330 => i pulled his swimming trunks down right there in the restaurant . 
10331 => i figured hed just pull them up quickly and that wed get a good laugh . 
10332 => anyway , billy just stood there , looking at me with this smirk on his face , bare assed naked . 
10333 => i didnt know what to do because he just stood there , swim trunks down around his knees , everyone in the restaurant gawking or gasping . 
10334 => cassey finally pulled his trunks back up . 
10335 => one of the waitresses had seen me do it , and the manager came over and threw me out . 
10336 => i was hungrier than hell , and it was the only place open in that whole damn town . 
10337 => i can remember sitting in the car all by myself , feeling like some little boy that was being punished . 
10338 => when did you get to know palmer ? 
10339 => i went through boot camp with billy , but i didnt really associate with him then . 
10340 => we had mostly texas , louisiana , and arkansas boys in our platoon , and billy was a northerner . 
10341 => he was kind of a loner type , but he got along okay . 
10342 => i think the only attitude toward him was , he was smart . 
10343 => he got quite a bit of attention from one of the dis . 
10344 => this wiry little di was always fucking with billy , trying to get him to laugh , then hed end up doing squat thrusts . 
10345 => we all thought billy was backwoods , being from some small hick town in minnesota . 
10346 => i remember he was fast as hell and really tough . 
10347 => one night some of the down home boys tried to give him a blanket party , and he knocked a couple of them around pretty good . 
10348 => after , i asked him if he did much fighting back home , and he said he had been playing hockey since he was four . 
10349 => i didnt put two and two together until i watched a hockey game a couple of years later . 
10350 => after boot camp we went home for a month , and then one month of itr training before vietnam . 
10351 => billy and i were in the same group in itr . 
10352 => most of my friends from boot camp went somewhere else , so palmer was kind of a familiar face . 
10353 => he also had some cousins that lived in the la . 
10354 => area , just up the highway from camp pendleton where we were . 
10355 => there were five of them , all good looking girls and they would come and get billy for the weekends , so naturally he was a good choice for a buddy , if you know what i mean ? 
10356 => i definitely hung around with him after our survival training . 
10357 => he could figure out things ; he knew the ropes . 
10358 => at the end of the training they had this exercise where they stuck us on this road , about fifty of us . 
10359 => the object was to go from this road , into the brush , and make it to another road about ten miles away . 
10360 => there was nothing between the two , but thick brush , trees , gullies , ravines and all kinds of nasty shit . 
10361 => there were aggressor teams all throughout the route , and if you got captured , you spent the weekend in their stockade where they could interrogate you . 
10362 => i heard that was really fun . 
10363 => all they gave you were two canteens full of water and a k-bar , thats a big ass knife . 
10364 => if and when you got to the other road , if you did , you could get a ride back to the camp and check out for liberty for the weekend . 
10365 => this started thursday morning , so you might end up spending the night out there if you didnt make the second road the first day . 
10366 => the rules said that if you captured a rattlesnake it was a free pass , you just brought it to the first observer and you were out of there , gone for the entire weekend . 
10367 => we knew about this and billy had done his homework . 
10368 => he found a guy that hunted snakes in that area . 
10369 => we get the go ahead and everybody heads into the trees , but billy goes about twenty feet , stops and cuts a branch , takes a coil of thin rope out of his pocket and makes a hoop contraption . 
10370 => then he makes a fork thing with another branch , finds the kind of spot this guy told him to look for , and ten minutes later , viola , hes got two rattlesnakes . 
10371 => we must have dug about ten of them out of this bank , and ten minutes later we are back on the road with our go-to-fun passes . 
10372 => this thing started at seven in the morning and by ten , billy and i are heading off base for a long weekend . 
10373 => almost half the guys didnt get back until sunday night after the aggressors let them go . 
10374 => i guess it was no picnic . 
10375 => i decided right there to stick close to billy . 
10376 => i was wondering how billy got wounded , you were there ? 
10377 => manny asked . 
10378 => yeah , all three times , tainer said . 
10379 => i never did get hit myself , cant figure out why i was so lucky . 
10380 => i guess billy exposed himself more , and i was more of a chicken , but extremely lucky for sure . 
10381 => one of the older guys in the section , he was there before us , told me that he had smelled a bullet go by . 
10382 => i said , yeah , right , and passed it off as bs . 
10383 => one day a round went just under my nose , the snap got my attention and i could smell the cordite . 
10384 => i wish hollywood could get that part right , tainer continued . 
10385 => there are two things that piss me off about the way they make movies . 
10386 => one is the actors are always cocking their guns , you know , to let the audience know something is going to happen . 
10387 => the macho-man move . 
10388 => thats such bullshit ! 
10389 => any idiot that walks around without a bullet in the chamber is not going to last very long . 
10390 => and two , when a high powered round passes , it doesnt whine , or buzz , it snaps . 
10391 => the bullet is traveling faster than the speed of sound and the sonic boom is real evident . 
10392 => when somebody shoots at you , the first thing you hear is the snap , right where the bullet passes and then the boom from the gun because the bullet gets to you before the sound from the gun . 
10393 => the first time billy got wounded , it was kind of my fault . 
10394 => we were with a platoon , like five days after they had shipped us up to con tien . 
10395 => it used to be this old french fort sitting on top of a plateau overlooking the river to north viet nam . 
10396 => we had been out in the bush for three days , kind of scouting the area . 
10397 => we were heading back in and ran into this platoon also going back in . 
10398 => we hooked up with them and damn if they werent told to stop and spend the night a couple of clicks short of the base . 
10399 => we didnt want to try getting back in at night because the crazy fuckers on the line would shoot at anything after it got dark . 
10400 => seeing we didnt carry radios , it was always the best to go in with units that did . 
10401 => so we started to dig in , but the ground was harder than hell . 
10402 => billy dug out about two feet , and then i took over . 
10403 => i got lazy and figured it was enough . 
10404 => the vc hit us with mortars that night , and i got in the hole first , but it wasnt deep enough and a piece of shrapnel caught billy in the back of the neck . 
10405 => he wasnt hurt too bad or anything , just bleeding like hell . 
10406 => they called in choppers to get the two kias and four wounded . 
10407 => he was gone for about four days , came back with a big bandage on his neck and a purple heart . 
10408 => he never said anything to me , but it was a big screw up on my part . 
10409 => from that time on , i never took anything for granted . 
10410 => i could have gotten him killed just by being lazy . 
10411 => that place con tien , like i said , was an old french fort . 
10412 => when we got there it was really pretty , this old stone fort all broken down , but covered with vines and moss . 
10413 => after we left three months later it was nothing but a pile of mud . 
10414 => between us and our bunkers and trenches , and the nva pounding the place with mortars and artillery it was kind of sad looking . 
10415 => the second time was just a nasty cut on his hand . 
10416 => we spotted an ambush developing , the walsh one , and after it was over billys hand was bloody . 
10417 => he didnt even know he was hit . 
10418 => the corpsman fixed it right there . 
10419 => the third time was a beaut , a cluster fuck from the word go . 
10420 => were on this landing strip , a whole battalion , four companies of marines waiting to be loaded on choppers for a big operation . 
10421 => it was hotter than hell , and we sat there from eight in the morning , and by noon , half the marines were sick from the heat or being scared . 
10422 => the original plan was to start dropping the first elements in first thing in the morning . 
10423 => that way they could get the whole battalion in by dark . 
10424 => at noon , nobody had even seen a chopper . 
10425 => billys saying , boy this is going to be fun , great bunch of warriors we have here . 
10426 => we knew where we were going , it was a bad , bad place , billy and i , and a couple of the other teams had gone in there . 
10427 => we had scoped it out . 
10428 => it was not a good place for large operations , a narrow valley , one way in , one way out . 
10429 => we had found bunkers on both sides of the valley , and worst of all , only one lz . 
10430 => finally , at almost twelve thirty the chinooks show up , theyre the big twin rotor choppers . 
10431 => a big , big target . 
10432 => the first group loads up at one , six chinooks , with fifteen marines apiece . 
10433 => the first group is dropped in the lz at one thirty , and its hotter than hell . 
10434 => the guys put on the ground have more than half their water gone already . 
10435 => within half an hour , fifty percent of the people on the ground are down with heat stroke . 
10436 => we go in the second group . 
10437 => billy and i loaded in the rear of the chopper right next to the ramp , on purpose . 
10438 => billy and i both know the supposed lz and are wondering whats up when the choppers go right over it and continue up the valley , dropping altitude . 
10439 => as the bird flares , it starts taking hits , shit flying around inside , then a big fireball above our heads , up in the turbines . 
10440 => billy goes out the door , and i follow , a long jump of about thirty feet into a flooded rice paddy . 
10441 => we start the day totally covered in stinking mud . 
10442 => the chinook pilot did a hell of a job and kept the wounded bird upright , smashing hard into the edge of the paddy . 
10443 => we didnt know the extent of the casualties because billy and i headed to the other side of the paddy to set up a perimeter . 
10444 => the rest of day is spent getting the heat stroke and combat casualties out , and a few supplies in . 
10445 => the nva didnt harass us at all the rest of the day and that night , but billy and i , and one other team had moved up into the high ground and spotted a lot of activity . 
10446 => nothing major , but we got glimpses of small nva units moving all around us . 
10447 => it was obvious that we were surrounded so we refrained from shooting . 
10448 => what had happened ; was the geniuses planning the operation had changed the lz at the last moment , moving it father up the valley . 
10449 => they didnt realize that the low clouds didnt burn off until later in the day , the farther up the valley they went . 
10450 => that was the reason for the big delay . 
10451 => so here we sit , less than a fourth of the planned number on the ground , and a whole night for the north vietnamese to plan a big reception for the next day . 
10452 => and get this , they still planned on bringing in the rest of the battalion at day break . 
10453 => they couldnt put two and two together and figure out that the next day was going to be the same , socked in until at least noon . 
10454 => that night we moved down to the valley , ready to hook up with the first unit we could find . 
10455 => we were looking for some kind of defensive position and some marines to help us hold on to it . 
10456 => we found a platoon from h company , lieutenant wynn was the officer . 
10457 => he was cool , had about six months in country . 
10458 => if you had something to say , he listened . 
10459 => he was also concerned because he was originally supposed to be the left flank , but with all the screw-ups , he was just trying to make some sort of position . 
10460 => he laughed when we reported what we knew , telling us that the original operational plans were still in effect , even though we had been dropped seven miles away from the original lz . 
10461 => in the morning , the powers that be figured we could all just pack up and get to where we were supposed to be , on foot . 
10462 => wynn wasnt too happy when we informed him of all the activity we had spotted . 
10463 => we tell wynn , we are in big trouble , expect lots of casualties . 
10464 => wynn says he suspects were right , but he cant stop it , no one listens to a lowly lieutenant . 
10465 => we confer : billy , myself , the other team , wilkes and a new guy sanders , and tell wynn that its likely that the nva are planning something . 
10466 => dont expect them to just hit and run in the morning . 
10467 => he gets his orders , move out at dawn , and we just laugh . 
10468 => we know we arent going anywhere the nva dont want us to , and it is going to be impossible to get air cover until at least noon . 
10469 => we tell him , god damnit wynn . 
10470 => theyre waiting for you . 
10471 => at day break , wynn splits up his force , sending two separate groups to look for a defensive position . 
10472 => he actually disobeys orders , and doesnt head for the original lz . 
10473 => hes a smart guy that ends up saving many his men that day . 
10474 => that night , he informed us that almost half of his men were green , five on their first field trip . 
10475 => we had spotted a small rise covered in grass the day before , and our group went to check it out . 
10476 => if we could dig in there it would be the best place . 
10477 => this all depended on whether the nva were already there or not . 
10478 => we scoped the hill from a mile and didnt see any movement , but that didnt guarantee anything . 
10479 => we had to cross this narrow paddy to get there and going across we started taking fire . 
10480 => if the nva are on the hill to the front we are in deep shit , but we get lucky and get the hill . 
10481 => there are some experienced guys in the group and they start to dig in . 
10482 => the squad leader called wynn , telling him to head our way , now ! 
10483 => wynn makes it to the paddy and starts across taking heavy fire from his rear . 
10484 => weve got a good position and hold the nva away from him . 
10485 => i dont think the nva following him expected us to be able to get hits at half a mile . 
10486 => wynn gets across with only a couple of casualties , nothing life threatening . 
10487 => by ten oclock we are dug in good , and wynn has told his men that it looks good , despite the obvious fact that some of the other units are engaged in heavy fighting . 
10488 => we can hear it over the radio , and the sounds of battle fill the valley . 
10489 => wynn calls in a couple of artillery rounds just to spot and mark as a precaution . 
10490 => just before eleven the shit hits the fan . 
10491 => there are nva all over us . 
10492 => by three that afternoon wynn is dead , he exposed himself continually playing lieutenant until he got it . 
10493 => billys been hit twice , once in the elbow , once a glancing blow in the chest , but is still fighting , yelling bip ! 
10494 => every time he drops one . 
10495 => sanders is dead , he was shot in the back . 
10496 => he couldnt pull himself up to fight anymore so he loaded empty magazines until he died . 
10497 => wilkes is out of action , bad head wound , and more than half of wynns men are down . 
10498 => by some miracle im still unscratched . 
10499 => it got so intense the sounds of the battle were drowned out . 
10500 => i could only sense the mechanical clicking of the 16 as i fired and fired . 
10501 => i found a target , pulled the trigger , the rifle clacked , jumped a little , and i looked for the next target . 
10502 => we got intensive air cover about then , and the nva broke off . 
10503 => the rest of the night we spent hunkered down , expecting the worst , but it never came . 
10504 => the night action was farther down the valley . 
10505 => i think we were about the only prepared position in the whole damn mess , and the nva took too many casualties trying to get to us and went after easier targets that night . 
10506 => they got us out by midmorning the next day , the dust offs coming in through the soup . 
10507 => billy was taken to a hospital , and that was the last time i saw him , until he came to see us a couple of years later . 
10508 => i kind of laid low the rest of my tour , about six weeks , and went home a happy man . 
10509 => did you know billy had gotten married ? 
10510 => manny asked . 
10511 => no , he hadnt the last time i talked to him . 
10512 => yeah , had a little girl too . 
10513 => they were both murdered . 
10514 => manny tells tainer the story . 
10515 => then about his going to yuma and meeting with the man that did it , eddy crane . 
10516 => you looked this guy up , are you nuts ? 
10517 => i couldnt help myself , manny said , sheepishly . 
10518 => before i knew it , i was there talking to him . 
10519 => i didnt know what else to do . 
10520 => boy , if youre going to get in the information gathering business you need to plan things out a little better . 
10521 => that man could be dangerous ! 
10522 => i doubt if he suspected me . 
10523 => im sure hes going to wonder if he doesnt hear from you , or are you planning to contact him again ? 
10524 => no , no , i just wanted to see what a man that could do those things would look like . 
10525 => i guess my curiosity got the best of me . 
10526 => i dont know manny , exposing yourself like that isnt too smart ? 
10527 => i hope youre right , but dont be surprised if he shows up . 
10528 => after all you did offer him something . 
10529 => hes going to expect you to come through . 
10530 => when are you planning to go back home ? 
10531 => tainer asked . 
10532 => well , you got me the return for tonight , i guess ill take that one . 
10533 => look , ive got some time tomorrow , middle of the day . 
10534 => why dont you stay until tomorrow evening , we can get together again ? 
10535 => you probably need to start your christmas shopping . 
10536 => i know i always put mine off until the last minute . 
10537 => new yorks a great place to shop . 
10538 => yeah , youre right about that . 
10539 => i could probably get something really special for cassey . 
10540 => i need to let her know i still love her , and not billy , considering the time ive spend on this adventure . 
10541 => great , its all set then . 
10542 => ill have my secretary take care of it . 
10543 => look , i feel bad about getting you to stay over and then not be able to spend any time with you tonight , but i am really tied up . 
10544 => i have prior commitments that would bore the hell out of you . 
10545 => give me your room and cell number and if i can get free , ill call . 
10546 => oh , dont worry , new york is a great city to spend an evening in . 
10547 => i can think of lots to do . 
10548 => besides , i dont take the phone with me , i hate the damn thing . 
10549 => * did billy have a nickname ? 
10550 => manny asked , back in marks office the next morning , standing , looking out the window . 
10551 => yes , ollie , tainer answered . 
10552 => ollie & sven . 
10553 => manny turned to tainer , grinning , a cocky look on his face and laughed . 
10554 => billy was telling you guys those jokes ? 
10555 => oh yeah , we laughed our asses off . 
10556 => where did ollie and sven come from ? 
10557 => theyre a common minnesota joke repertoire , the swedish meatballs , billy called them . 
10558 => you know , manny hesitated , thinking . 
10559 => billy made up many of those jokes himself . 
10560 => it was like he had an inside to the characters tell me about lena , mark said , leaning forward . 
10561 => billy said he knew a real life one . 
10562 => oh god , that would be cassey ! 
10563 => manny exclaimed . 
10564 => how did he describe her ? 
10565 => oh , let me think now , ah lets see . 
10566 => this lena was this nordic blond bomb shell that was ollies girl . 
10567 => the way he put it , we all fell in love immediately . 
10568 => she had um , i cant remember quite how it goes , wheels and motor something . 
10569 => she had hellacious wheels , all the way up to her motor ? 
10570 => manny finished , laughing again . 
10571 => yeah , thats it ! 
10572 => id just think about billys graphic description of lena and save lot of strain on my hand , tainer hesitated . 
10573 => ah , arent we talking about your wife ? 
10574 => oh , dont worry , cassey loved it . 
10575 => i dont know about you guys cutting down on the revs , but she loved being a part of billys making everybody laugh . 
10576 => its strange how you can forget something important like that . 
10577 => it just slips out of your mind and then all at once it surfaces again . 
10578 => you having a flash back ? 
10579 => yeah , i was thinking about ollie and sven , i was sven . 
10580 => thats how close we all were . 
10581 => billy , cassey and i . 
10582 => god , it was great times . 
10583 => id forgotten how hilarious billy could be . 
10584 => boy , that was a long time ago . 
10585 => manny made a clicking sound with his tongue , looking out the window again , a faraway look transfixing on his face . 
10586 => before he went away . 
10587 => manny turned back to mark with a serious look . 
10588 => i wish i would have done something to rekindle that friendship . 
10589 => now its too late . 
10590 => better late , than never . 
10591 => but what does it do for the billys of the world , the ones that are gone and forgotten ? 
10592 => maybe they get remembered , like they deserve . 
10593 => but i missed the chance to tell him to his face . 
10594 => how i appreciated him for being billy . 
10595 => thats what should have happened , not the indifference we ended up having for each other . 
10596 => well , apathy among friends is ridiculous , so to cleanse thy soul , why not tell it to me , tainer said . 
10597 => im sort of guilty too . 
10598 => id like to hear more about billy , what he was like before he fell into that meat grinder . 
10599 => manny looked at tainer , feeling a kinship . 
10600 => billy was funnier than hell and could get away with almost everything he did , manny said , finally coming to sit down . 
10601 => teachers loved him . 
10602 => in eighth grade we would have film days . 
10603 => billy taped a playboy center fold on the screen and rolled it back up . 
10604 => the teacher pulled the screen down and everyone started laughing . 
10605 => the teacher had his back to the screen so he couldnt figure it out . 
10606 => finally this girl in the front row gets him to turn around . 
10607 => he looked at the picture for a bit and shook his head . 
10608 => i guess ill be seeing mr 
10609 => palmer after class , he said , taking the pinup down . 
10610 => i stopped after hockey practice , and billy and this teacher are shooting the breeze , just like old friends . 
10611 => chapter 23 come on doggy , hop on in , cassey said to george of the jungle as she held the drivers seat forward for him to get in the back . 
10612 => her suv , was still inside the garage . 
10613 => george took his customary position in the back seat on the floor . 
10614 => george loved to go with her , but she could never figure out why because he stayed on the floor and was never seen . 
10615 => she figured it was his favorite place to sleep . 
10616 => its thursday , and every tuesday and thursday afternoon she drove five miles on the back roads to the high school in the next town for her aerobics class . 
10617 => cassey was very diligent about her exercise . 
10618 => she hadnt missed a class in a long time . 
10619 => as she backed out of the garage , she thought about how manny would hate this day , cloudy and gray , the forecast calling for another six to ten inches of snow . 
10620 => i know manny has never liked winter , and i shouldnt feel annoyed about him leaving again , considering how bad the weather is going to get . 
10621 => he seems happier this year , the traveling has been good for him . 
10622 => cassey smiled at the thought . 
10623 => and the billy project . 
10624 => i know hes been bored at work for years , ever since andy died . 
10625 => andy was such a pain in the butt . 
10626 => manny had to take up the slack , but since then it has all gone smooth and manny has built a great business . 
10627 => he doesnt have much to do there anymore , it all runs so well . 
10628 => now hes got something to sink his teeth into . 
10629 => cassey had made it out of town , driving down the two lane road for the neighboring high school . 
10630 => it started to snow , but she liked the white soothing calm it brought her . 
10631 => cassey was thinking about why she and manny felt so differently about this season . 
10632 => its the quietness that i love about winter , the stillness and the slowed down pace . 
10633 => lost in speculation , cassey barely noticed a big , black truck behind her and gave it no thought . 
10634 => the road was bordered on both sides by high snow banks made by the snow plows , and a little farther back , big trees . 
10635 => there were very few houses out this way , the area was known for its wildness . 
10636 => cassey was cruising along , enjoying the scenery . 
10637 => the new snow was heavy and wet , sticking to the branches of the trees . 
10638 => she looked into the rear view mirror , and the black truck was right on her tail , getting ready to pass her . 
10639 => some dork in a hurry , not appreciating the winter wonderland . 
10640 => she sighed , as the truck swung out to pass and charged forward . 
10641 => the truck went past , moving out in front of her suv , when suddenly its brake lights came on , startling her . 
10642 => the black truck turned right in front of her , starting to slide sideways , blocking the road . 
10643 => cassey jammed on her brakes . 
10644 => goddamn idiot ! 
10645 => cassey shouted , as the big truck continued to brake right in front of her . 
10646 => the black truck lost control , and the rear end slid out , brushing the tall snow bank on the far side of the road . 
10647 => cassey also continued braking , staying behind the out of control truck . 
10648 => the big truck continued sideways down the road , loosing speed , but still blocking the road . 
10649 => the truck came to a stop and so did cassey . 
10650 => the truck was ten feet in front of her suv , and her first thought was , thank god there was no accident . 
10651 => the drivers side door of the truck , facing away from her , opened and a smallish man appeared , trotting around the front of the black truck . 
10652 => cassey wasnt alarmed at first , but she suddenly realized the man had a ski mask covering his face , and was headed right for her . 
10653 => cassey instinctively hit the power lock , securing the doors to the suv , as the man ran up to her window . 
10654 => she was just about to put the suv in reverse , when the attacker pulled a metal bar out of his coat with his left hand , and swung wildly at her side window , smashing it in , covering her in shattered glass . 
10655 => she had the suv in reverse , and rammed the throttle down . 
10656 => cassey operated the four-wheel-drive vehicle in two wheel drive most of the time because she was told ; it uses less gas that way . 
10657 => the suvs rear wheels spun on the icy road , and the vehicle hardly moved , as her assailant reached in through the shattered window . 
10658 => the man grabbed for the inside door handle , grasping it with his left hand , pulling the handle up and opening the door . 
10659 => he backed off slightly , allowing the door to open enough so there was room for him to reach into the cab , to grab for cassey . 
10660 => cassey was scrambling away from him toward the passengers side of the cab , kicking at him with her legs , screaming as loud as she could . 
10661 => the shrieking hurt his ears as he started to move toward the panicking cassey , trying to grab one of her thrashing legs . 
10662 => the first indication that something was amiss was the heavy , musky smell the assailant detected moments before he was hit . 
10663 => the sudden , violent attack from the back seat was totally unexpected , as george of the jungle rammed the man with one-hundred pounds of furry and savage teeth . 
10664 => before the attacker realized what had happened , george grabbed his right upper arm in his huge mouth , and was driving him back out of casseys suv . 
10665 => georges massive weight drove them both down toward the icy roadway . 
10666 => the attacker got lucky , as georges momentum carried the huge dog over him , loosening the crushing grip on his arm , both of them spinning around , temporarily separated . 
10667 => the man ended up on his knees , with george stretched out on the slippery road , his legs splayed out , churning and slipping , trying to get back to his feet , to renew the assault . 
10668 => the dog , unable to get a solid footing , allowed the man just enough room and time to swing the metal rod , violently , producing a lucky shot , catching george at the back of the skull , knocking the dog back down with a sickening crunch . 
10669 => the man and george collapsed back on the slippery roadway . 
10670 => the man tried to stand on the ice , dropping the metal bar , managing to get to his knees first , his jacket torn and his right arm hanging weakly . 
10671 => he grabbed his damaged arm above the elbow with the other hand and stood slowly , looking into the suv , to cassey . 
10672 => she had the glove box open and was fumbling around in it . 
10673 => the man had no idea what may be in there and he was hurt too bad to continue the assault . 
10674 => blood was dripping from his damaged arm , on to the roadway , as he headed back for the black truck , stumbling and sliding around the front , trying to reach the still open drivers door . 
10675 => casseys was in shock , finally getting the cell phone she pulled out of the glove box turned on , her breath coming in short , thick gasps . 
10676 => she moved like she was in a dream , slowly , deliberately , as she watched the man painfully pull the door of his truck shut . 
10677 => she sat back up behind her steering wheel , gripping it with white knuckles , as the black truck backed up , stopped , started forward , turning to accelerate straight down the road , away from her . 
10678 => as the assailants truck disappeared into the falling snow , cassey sat ridged , frosty , short contrails of breath shooting out of her mouth . 
10679 => she tried to slow her breathing , trying to piece together what had just happened . 
10680 => she was uncertain what to do next , now that the danger was gone . 
10681 => it wasnt until she looked out the open door of the suv and saw her beloved george laying still on the cold road that she finally reacted , picking the phone off the seat and dialing quickly . 
10682 => * the first sheriff car arrived a few minutes later , and found cassey sitting in the road , crying . 
10683 => her tears were frozen to her cheeks , georges head cradled in her lap . 
10684 => the deputy recognized mrs 
10685 => anderson immediately and when he asked her what happened , she responded with , that son-of-a-bitch killed my dog . 
10686 => the deputy was slightly confused , getting cassey to respond any farther was difficult . 
10687 => she was holding on to the dog tightly , and the officer couldnt get her to let loose , or answer any of his questions . 
10688 => the deputy was kneeling down , his hand on her shoulder , trying to question the despondent cassey . 
10689 => ill never forgive that son-of-a-bitch for this , cassey said , finally looking up to the deputy , a look of anger in her tear streaked eyes . 
10690 => whos that mam , who did this ? 
10691 => asked deputy auburn . 
10692 => he hadnt a clue yet about what happened . 
10693 => that fuckin manny , i warned him ! 
10694 => this is his fault ! 
10695 => cassey shouted . 
10696 => manny anderson , thats your husband , right ? 
10697 => he did this ? 
10698 => auburn asked . 
10699 => he couldnt leave it alone , and this is what happened ! 
10700 => auburn stroked georges head , looking for clues and noticed some blood on the dogs mussel . 
10701 => he pulled the skin back to look at the teeth . 
10702 => are you hurt mam , theres blood he started to comment , but noticed the metal rod lying on the road and then the trail of blood leading away to tire tracks heading off down the road . 
10703 => he correctly surmised that mrs 
10704 => anderson had been involved in a serious incident . 
10705 => who killed your dog ? 
10706 => the deputy asked , starting the investigation . 
10707 => that fuckin manny , its his fault ! 
10708 => i warned him ! 
10709 => cassey shouted , as the deputy quickly headed back to his patrol car and called for more officers . 
10710 => he went to see a guy in arizona ! 
10711 => cassey shouted to the deputy as he sat half in , half out of his patrol car . 
10712 => thats the guy that killed george ! 
10713 => your husband knows the man that did this ? 
10714 => the deputy shouted back . 
10715 => he doesnt know him , he just went to see him ! 
10716 => cassey explained . 
10717 => chapter 24 a little later cassey was sitting in the police station , still a little shaky , grasping a hot cup of coffee with both hands . 
10718 => a detective in a heavy woolen shirt , jeans , and snow mobile boots was sitting backwards in a chair . 
10719 => his arms were crossed , elbows resting on the back of the chair , his chin resting on his wrists . 
10720 => the detective wasnt saying anything , waiting for cassey to compose herself . 
10721 => did you find the guy ? 
10722 => cassey asked , looking to the detective . 
10723 => were not exactly sure who to look for , yet ? 
10724 => got any ideas ? 
10725 => the deputy answered . 
10726 => i told the first sheriff , look for a guy from arizona . 
10727 => he had arizona plates on the big black truck ? 
10728 => i dont know , but the guy my husband went to see lives in arizona . 
10729 => i see . 
10730 => weve been trying to contact your husband , but it seems that his whereabouts are unknown . 
10731 => he left no itinerary ? 
10732 => the detective asked . 
10733 => no , i dont know where he is , just in new york . 
10734 => he usually phones home every evening . 
10735 => is this normal , going on a trip , and you dont know where to contact him ? 
10736 => you know , just in case ? 
10737 => the detective added with a note of skepticism in his voice . 
10738 => no , this trip was a spur of the moment , and i guess , i forgot to ask , and he didnt tell . 
10739 => manny and i base our relationship on trust . 
10740 => it is not uncommon for us to be out of contact a day or two , now and then . 
10741 => i let him have his space , and he lets me have mine . 
10742 => i see , but i talked to his secretary and shes in the dark too . 
10743 => says mr 
10744 => anderson had no business come up in new york as far as she knows . 
10745 => whats going on mrs 
10746 => anderson ? 
10747 => this attack doesnt seem random . 
10748 => it looks like someone knew your habits and had a plan . 
10749 => i told you , the guy from arizona . 
10750 => manny was trying to put the screws to him . 
10751 => this guy has no name , as far as you know ? 
10752 => the deputy commented with a note of sarcasm in his voice . 
10753 => we cant start picking up people just because they happen to be from arizona , now can we ? 
10754 => dont patronize me , cassey shot back . 
10755 => my husband only mentioned his name once and im sorry , but i cant remember it . 
10756 => im sorry too mam , but obviously there was a crime committed . 
10757 => youve got a dead dog , and there is blood at the scene . 
10758 => the mention of george started cassey crying again . 
10759 => so im not doubting your story , but i need information . 
10760 => i want to solve this as fast as i can . 
10761 => the longer we trifle , the farther away the perp gets , understand ? 
10762 => poor george , he was such a nice doggy , cassey sobbed . 
10763 => i dont know what to tell you . 
10764 => until i hear from my husband , i dont know how to help you , casseys volume went up . 
10765 => i cant remember the name ! 
10766 => she shouted frustrated . 
10767 => thats okay mrs 
10768 => anderson , calm down . 
10769 => weve put out a description of the truck , and if the man used a hotel or rented it , and if he was dumb enough to add an arizona address , we might get lucky . 
10770 => youre sure about the gloves , he never took them off . 
10771 => no , cassey sniffled . 
10772 => im positive he had them on the whole time . 
10773 => well , ive got the crime team going over your truck anyway . 
10774 => you never know . 
10775 => about this physical description you gave us , this is a little vague . 
10776 => he was wearing a lot of clothes , its very cold out , you know . 
10777 => yes , i know . 
10778 => mrs 
10779 => anderson , are you sure there isnt anything you could tell us about the man , any little thing that we could use ? 
10780 => i already told you , he had a ski mask on so i couldnt possibly tell you anything about his face , but his ears stuck out , i think ? 
10781 => thats good , thats a start . 
10782 => im sorry , but after i saw the ski mask , i sort of got excited . 
10783 => i dont think i was paying too much attention to him . 
10784 => i was just thinking about getting away . 
10785 => i want you to try to recall anything about this man , about his features , his shape , his movements , anything . 
10786 => the detective pushed back from the chair and stood up . 
10787 => oh , officer , cassey cried , reaching for her purse , then rummaging around inside . 
10788 => i just remembered , theres a publisher in new york my husband might call , at least he was supposed to . 
10789 => cassey handed the officer the number of mark tainer . 
10790 => the detective returned after about fifteen minutes . 
10791 => mrs 
10792 => anderson , does the name edward crane mean anything to you ? 
10793 => thats the guy , cassey shouted , standing up quickly , thats the guy from arizona . 
10794 => you got him ? 
10795 => no , just the name . 
10796 => if you didnt catch him , how do you know his name ? 
10797 => cassey asked suspiciously . 
10798 => the publisher , mark tainer , i just spoke to him and he did talk with your husband . 
10799 => mr 
10800 => anderson informed this mark tainer about an edward crane , and some beef with the va 
10801 => im not sure what the total story is , but at least we have a name now . 
10802 => mr 
10803 => tainer sends his best . 
10804 => im sending you home with a deputy and she will remain with you until we get a better picture of whats going down . 
10805 => is that okay ? 
10806 => i , i ya , i guess so . 
10807 => you couldnt find my husband ? 
10808 => no , but i sure do want to talk to him . 
10809 => mr 
10810 => tainer said mr 
10811 => anderson told him he had to meet with a business associate from arizona . 
10812 => cassey looked at the detective with a startled look on her face . 
10813 => as soon as you get home check your messages , and have mr 
10814 => anderson call me if you speak to him . 
10815 => i mean right away mrs 
10816 => anderson . 
10817 => the detective was very stern sounding . 
10818 => * cassey was at home sitting on the couch , the fireplace roaring . 
10819 => shed taken a shower , had a little to eat and was working on her second drink . 
10820 => a female deputy , carrie conner , was there with her . 
10821 => cassey was feeling a little better , except when she thought about george , but she was confident the second drink will help there too . 
10822 => when cassey had gotten home there was a phone message from manny . 
10823 => he would arrive minneapolis 5:16 p.m 
10824 => standard time and cassey relayed it to the detective . 
10825 => detective swenson said he would be at the gate when manny arrived . 
10826 => * at 5:46 p 
10827 => m 
10828 => casseys phone rang , and conners answered it as agreed . 
10829 => its your husband . 
10830 => carrie said , as she handed the phone to cassey . 
10831 => cassey ! 
10832 => manny was breathing hard . 
10833 => my god , are you all right ? 
10834 => where are you ? 
10835 => she asked , a very unfriendly tone in her voice im still in the airport . 
10836 => i just got the word . 
10837 => there was a detective swenson waiting for me . 
10838 => cassey , are you all right ? 
10839 => yeah , im okay , but george is dead . 
10840 => i know , the detective told me , manny said sadly . 
10841 => youre okay though , thats all that matters . 
10842 => yeah , im okay , but thats not all that matters , manny ! 
10843 => you screwed up manny ! 
10844 => anderson , you pulled a boner and you got george killed , and im pissed . 
10845 => hey , we dont know what happened yet manny was contrite , trying to defend himself because he knew cassey and could hear the anger in her voice . 
10846 => cassey cut him off . 
10847 => screw you bub ! 
10848 => i warned you ! 
10849 => this irresponsible shit , running all over , your head stuck up your tail pipe , and now george is dead ! 
10850 => i loved that dog , manny , and hes dead , because you screwed up ! 
10851 => cassey slammed the phone down . 
10852 => * manny held the disconnected phone in his hand , looking at it . 
10853 => detective swenson was watching him . 
10854 => boy , shes pissed , manny said , putting the receiver back . 
10855 => i can tell when she starts using the word screwed . 
10856 => that means somebodys going to . 
10857 => somebody tried to kill her . 
10858 => if it was me , id be a little upset to , swenson said . 
10859 => my advice is get on home , shell calm down . 
10860 => i hope so , otherwise im in big trouble . 
10861 => have you got a line on this crane character yet ? 
10862 => not yet , sir , but i dont really know the story . 
10863 => i had someone drive me in so we can discuss this on the trip back to red pine . 
10864 => swenson picked up mannys overnight bag . 
10865 => chapter 25 manny finally got home at 10:00 p.m . 
10866 => it was a grueling drive because the detective was relentless , going over and over what manny had to tell him , taking notes constantly , asking the same questions . 
10867 => the house was dark when the garage door slid up and manny drove in . 
10868 => when he came through the door to the kitchen he saw a lamp on in the den area . 
10869 => he didnt see the light when he came up the driveway and was startled by a strange voice when he walked into the room . 
10870 => welcome home mr 
10871 => anderson , dont be alarmed . 
10872 => my name is carrie conner and im with the county sheriffs office . 
10873 => im here to look after your wife . 
10874 => shit lady , no one told me youd be here . 
10875 => im sorry , id have thought you would have been informed . 
10876 => some policy youve got , i could have died from a heart attack or something . 
10877 => im sorry sir , some sort of oversight . 
10878 => i guess ! 
10879 => wheres my wife ? 
10880 => shes asleep , down in one of the boys rooms . 
10881 => we thought it would be best . 
10882 => id like to see her , if thats all right ? 
10883 => oh , of course , go right ahead . 
10884 => ill be here if you need me . 
10885 => im sure you will , manny snapped because he was on edge . 
10886 => first the news about cassey and george , now the police taking over his life . 
10887 => he had never been involved in any kind of situation concerning the law , and it was unsettling how overwhelming the experience had become . 
10888 => they definitely do take charge , crossed his mind as he went down the hall . 
10889 => he found cassey in donnys room , the last bedroom down the hall . 
10890 => as he entered he could smell the slight odor of alcohol . 
10891 => cassey seldom drank , and this was a bad omen . 
10892 => he sat on the bed wondering how to approach the situation finally made it , huh ? 
10893 => cassey was turned away from him so her voice was faint . 
10894 => rough day , huh ? 
10895 => manny said sheepishly because he didnt know what else to say . 
10896 => not as rough as georges . 
10897 => manny could detect the anger in her voice . 
10898 => geez , im going to miss that big lummox , manny added . 
10899 => should have thought about that before , mr 
10900 => cassey rolled a little toward her back . 
10901 => a little late now . 
10902 => why are you acting like i made some terrific booboo , and now youre paying for it ? 
10903 => manny started losing his cool . 
10904 => because that is exactly how it went ! 
10905 => cassey shouted , turning all the way to face him . 
10906 => jesus christ manny , what a dumb fuck thing to do . 
10907 => you go and threaten a guy thats a known killer , and when he responds , you go whoops ! 
10908 => fucking duh , manny ! 
10909 => for your information , the police arent certain that crane had anything to do with it . 
10910 => they found him , and guess what ? 
10911 => no dog bites . 
10912 => whatre they trying to pull ? 
10913 => cassey moved up onto her elbows . 
10914 => george got him good , i saw the blood . 
10915 => they got crane in phoenix and checked him out , and no dog bites . 
10916 => you tell me ? 
10917 => i , im too tired to work this out , so go up to bed , and well do it in the morning . 
10918 => cassey plopped back down and rolled away from manny . 
10919 => you coming up ? 
10920 => manny asked . 
10921 => not with you , cassey snorted . 
10922 => ah huh , manny said , heading out of the room . 
10923 => im in deep dudu on the home front . 
10924 => manny , you find someone else i can blame for this , and youre off the hook , but not until . 
10925 => cassey said loudly , as he left the room . 
10926 => chapter 26 manny came into the kitchen the next morning , the smell of fresh coffee drawing him there . 
10927 => it was just starting to get light outside , still too dark to judge what kind of day it will be weather wise , but a dreary day is the least of my worries . 
10928 => cassey was sitting at the breakfast bar , talking on the phone . 
10929 => manny walked up , putting both hands on her shoulders , and she stopped talking , he tried to message her the way she liked it . 
10930 => normally , cassey would relax , letting her shoulders drop to enjoy the sensation . 
10931 => this morning however , she stiffened , hinting that the attempt at reconciliation is not wanted . 
10932 => manny removed his hands and sighed . 
10933 => who you talking to ? 
10934 => mom and dad ? 
10935 => oh , tell them hi . 
10936 => manny moved off , headed toward the coffee . 
10937 => cassey didnt resume the conversation until he was around the bar , out of hearing range . 
10938 => as he poured his cup full he can hear cassey talking again in a hushed , guarded volume . 
10939 => he walked over to the window and looked out . 
10940 => it had gotten a little bit lighter , so he could see . 
10941 => it was not a real dismal day , partly cloudy , but it looked cold out there . 
10942 => he looked around the yard , subconsciously waiting for george to appear , and then it hit him . 
10943 => for the first time since this hammer has come down on his life he feels the real loss . 
10944 => george is gone , and cassey blames him . 
10945 => manny turned and looked to cassey as she put the phone down and looked at him . 
10946 => i talked to detective swenson just before my parents , she said calmly . 
10947 => has he figured out what the hell is going on ? 
10948 => manny asked hopefully . 
10949 => no , he called to say he was on his way to phoenix . 
10950 => good , hell get to the bottom of this , manny tried to sound confident . 
10951 => manny , im going to my parents . 
10952 => when ? 
10953 => manny asked surprised . 
10954 => ive got to get packed , marilyns coming to get me . 
10955 => shell drive me to the bus station , cassey said getting up . 
10956 => but ? 
10957 => manny said , walking toward cassey . 
10958 => detective swenson thinks its a good idea , cassey said , dogging him , backing out of the room . 
10959 => swenson ? 
10960 => manny was confused and angry . 
10961 => yes , he would like me to go somewhere until he can get some answers . 
10962 => he says that it was supposed to look random , but he feels it was planned . 
10963 => i was the target . 
10964 => hes not sure , but he feels that you might have something to do with this , cassey said sadly . 
10965 => he cant do that ! 
10966 => manny yelled . 
10967 => he cant accuse me with no justification . 
10968 => what the hell does that guy think hes doing ? 
10969 => manny , i dont care , im leaving for a while . 
10970 => im so frightened , or angry , or both , i dont know what to do ? 
10971 => cassey was talking fast , and manny could sense that she didnt want to give him an opening to defend himself . 
10972 => the boys and i will be spending christmas with my parents . 
10973 => i dont want you talking to donny or danny , understand . 
10974 => theyll just be confused , just like i am . 
10975 => youre shutting me off from my family ? 
10976 => manny pleaded . 
10977 => what about my side of the issue ? 
10978 => your side screwed up ! 
10979 => cassey declared . 
10980 => stop saying that ! 
10981 => manny shouted . 
10982 => i doesnt make any difference , you are at fault . 
10983 => either you or crane did this . 
10984 => what if it was just a random thing ? 
10985 => swenson says , not the case . 
10986 => they found the black truck in the minneapolis airport . 
10987 => it was a rental , stolen credit card . 
10988 => theres blood in the cab , its not a match with the blood they have , yet , but detective swenson is sure it will be . 
10989 => detective swenson is very sure of himself . 
10990 => does anyone realize this is my life thats being turned upside down ? 
10991 => were you attacked manny ? 
10992 => cassey shouted . 
10993 => no . 
10994 => well , i was , and to tell you the truth , im glad i have someone looking out for my well-being because you , my husband , are doing little to comfort me right now . 
10995 => youre pushing me away , you dont trust me . 
10996 => what can i do with that ? 
10997 => cassey looked at him , and he could see no sympathy in her stare . 
10998 => her glare was broken when she looked past him to the window . 
10999 => manny turned , as marilyn gwynns car was coming up the drive . 
11000 => nasty bitch must be loving this , manny said under his breath . 
11001 => manny and marilyn dont like each other , never did . 
11002 => i suppose the town crier has spread the word ? 
11003 => manny said angrily , nodding toward the driveway . 
11004 => only worried about your image , huh manny ? 
11005 => hey , im an innocent man . 
11006 => i dont have anything else to worry about . 
11007 => well see , cassey said , hurrying past manny . 
11008 => * cassey wasted no time , she and marilyn had packed her things in the car and were ready to go in fifteen minutes . 
11009 => manny noted this was some sort of record . 
11010 => first time shes not going to not be late for something , and i dont get to enjoy it , figures . 
11011 => cassey was serious about leaving and leaving quick , so manny didnt even try to talk . 
11012 => marilyn gave him knowing little smiles whenever she walked by him . 
11013 => manny didnt know why cassey had remained friends with her for all these years . 
11014 => marilyn has had four husbands and all four agree that it was the worst experience of their lives . 
11015 => marilyn is also the town gossip and resident trouble maker . 
11016 => marilyn spends her days deflecting all the turbulence she causes , by making everyone elses lives miserable . 
11017 => the ultimate drama queen , manny silently surmised , watching marilyn rejoice in his ruined life . 
11018 => i trust you can handle everything here , without screwing anything else up ? 
11019 => ill call when i get there , cassey said as she walked out the door , rushing to the car . 
11020 => she didnt even look his way , as marilyn backs down the drive , the smirk still on her face . 
11021 => a sheriffs car pulled in behind as an escort . 
11022 => manny stood in the door for a couple of minutes , thinking , uncertain on how to proceed . 
11023 => finally getting cold , he turned around to go inside . 
11024 => deputy conner was still there , standing in the living room looking at him . 
11025 => ah , can i help you ? 
11026 => manny didnt know what else to say because hes growing tired of the police . 
11027 => id like to ask you a few questions , if you dont mind ? 
11028 => conner answered . 
11029 => and maybe look around . 
11030 => you the second squad ? 
11031 => you might say that . 
11032 => that doesnt offend you , i hope , i mean , talking to a woman . 
11033 => oh hell no , youre probably the only woman thats going to talk to me anyway . 
11034 => im sorry , sir , but these things do have a way of disrupting peoples lives . 
11035 => christ , these people come from a mold . 
11036 => manny recognized the condescending sneakiness , first noticing it in swensons methods . 
11037 => what can i help you with , coffee maybe , for a starter ? 
11038 => manny asked . 
11039 => no , ive had my fill , thank you . 
11040 => too much and ill have sparks flying between my fingertips , the deputy said . 
11041 => ha , ha , thats a good one , havent heard it before , manny returned , laughing . 
11042 => what can i help you with , then ? 
11043 => i would like to look around house , as part of the investigation . 
11044 => if you dont mind ? 
11045 => dont you need a search warrant ? 
11046 => of course , if you dont want me to ? 
11047 => but , if you just give me your permission , then its okay . 
11048 => im kind of getting my feet wet in investigations , so the sheriff felt this might be a good place to learn , carrie said , not indicating that to refuse would add any suspicion to her mind . 
11049 => im just trying to see if anything can lead us to who attacked your wife . 
11050 => you never know what might be here the buggers , they want something to tie me to it . 
11051 => well , let them look . 
11052 => manny was angry , but the intrusions dont look like they will dissipate for the near future . 
11053 => deputy carrie headed toward the rear of the house , manny following . 
11054 => he watched her , wondering what shes looking for , interested to see how she goes about it . 
11055 => is there something i can help you with mr 
11056 => anderson ? 
11057 => manny can tell the deputy is uncomfortable with him watching . 
11058 => no , i can help you deputy ! 
11059 => you see this is my house ! 
11060 => i was going to help you find your way around . 
11061 => any problems with that ? 
11062 => do you have any idea what may have started all this ? 
11063 => no , sir , i dont have the slightest idea . 
11064 => then , what the hell are you supposed to be looking for ? 
11065 => i guess , i wont know , until i find it . 
11066 => i dont believe you fuckin people , manny shouted . 
11067 => a crimes committed , and you throw out a net so big you dont know what youre dragging in . 
11068 => i think a sense of responsibility might be called for , dont you ? 
11069 => i was only instructed to by who deputy ? 
11070 => manny interrupted . 
11071 => whos your leader ? 
11072 => deputy carrie just looked at him , either unwilling , or unable to understand what hes asking . 
11073 => whos in charge of the pod ? 
11074 => manny finally resorted to cynicism . 
11075 => im sorry , sir , my orders are to observe . 
11076 => who gave you the supposed technique ? 
11077 => manny waited and got nothing . 
11078 => who told you how to observe ? 
11079 => detective swenson is an expert on evidence gathering , conner stated . 
11080 => ah huh , and what makes detective swenson an expert ? 
11081 => he attended the fbis crime lab . 
11082 => bingo ! 
11083 => tell me deputy , how many big cases have there been around here , since junior graduated from spy school ? 
11084 => deputy conners said nothing , finally accepting the ribbing from manny . 
11085 => he can tell , she doesnt know how to continue . 
11086 => look , carrie , you want some insight on how this started , just ask me ? 
11087 => dont presume that you are going to roam around my home , looking for something to dump on me with , because , i didnt have anything to do with my wifes attack . 
11088 => pass that on to swenson when you talk to him , tell him ill take a lie detector test , just for him . 
11089 => im sorry mr 
11090 => anderson , im just trying to do my job , carrie replied emotionally . 
11091 => geez i hope she doesnt start crying . 
11092 => . 
11093 => .unless its all a trick to whittle me down ? 
11094 => deputy , has anyone mentioned the name billy palmer to you ? 
11095 => manny asked . 
11096 => conner , reached into her breast pocket and whipped out a note book , already back from the crisis . 
11097 => the name was mentioned by your wife , i believe , carrie said , flipping pages . 
11098 => jesus , shes got a book in there already . 
11099 => manny thought , watching conner check her notes . 
11100 => yes , here it is . 
11101 => conner smiled proudly . 
11102 => he was a vietnam vet , an old friend you were researching ? 
11103 => is that right ? 
11104 => researching . 
11105 => . 
11106 => .yeah deputy , i guess that would be right . 
11107 => he was an old friend and i was looking into his life . 
11108 => thats how i came across eddy crane , does that name ring a bell ? 
11109 => yes , detective swenson has gone to phoenix to interrogate him . 
11110 => good , youre on the ball . 
11111 => now billy palmers life had a connection to this mr 
11112 => crane , and i found out about it , and may have stirred something up . 
11113 => that is probably why you and i are talking here now . 
11114 => i see , conner said , writing furiously in her note book . 
11115 => is there anything else i should know about this mr 
11116 => palmer ? 
11117 => my wife was compiling some things in her computer , its in the office down the hall . 
11118 => do you know anything about them ? 
11119 => yes , sir , thats my specialty , data recovery . 
11120 => deputy carrie was excited because they had moved into her area . 
11121 => fine , you have my permission to have a go at the monster machine , manny said gesturing toward the office , as the phone rang . 
11122 => he followed conner to the office , the closest phone being in there . 
11123 => conners sat down at the desk , as manny picked up the phone . 
11124 => hello , my life is in the crapper , so dump away , manny said into the phone . 
11125 => jiminy manny , what the heck is going on ? 
11126 => carl andrews answered . 
11127 => i just talked to fred maynard and he said you tried to kill cassey ? 
11128 => what the heck is he talking about ? 
11129 => great ! 
11130 => manny exclaimed , then hesitated , realizing how far this thing had really gotten already . 
11131 => look carl , somebody attacked cassey , or tried to , george got in the way yeah , fred said you killed the dog too , carl cut him off . 
11132 => you tell fred to can it , or hes next . 
11133 => manny immediately regretted the comment because conner looked up at him , but at least she didnt go for the note book or her gun . 
11134 => im kidding carl . 
11135 => its just one of those stories thats gotten blown out of proportion . 
11136 => marilyn gwynn is involved , sucking up to cassey . 
11137 => oh , christ , carl rarely used anything even close to profanity , not her ! 
11138 => marilyn had been carls first sexual encounter way back in high school , and manny was sure it must have been traumatic for the inexperienced andrews . 
11139 => marilyn the mauler had been her moniker back then . 
11140 => none of what im hearing is true , is it ? 
11141 => andrews asked softly . 
11142 => of course not ! 
11143 => jesus carl , i cant believe anyone would think i could hurt cassey , but its a mess . 
11144 => i know , i was just flabbergasted . 
11145 => how you doing ? 
11146 => oh , all right , i guess , but ive got cops up my butt . 
11147 => man , they sure steam roll the situation . 
11148 => thats their job manny , so be careful . 
11149 => dont talk to them without representation . 
11150 => oh , ive got nothing to hide . 
11151 => theres one here now , going through casseys computer . 
11152 => what , in your house ? 
11153 => andrewss voice went up many notches . 
11154 => yeah , whats the big deal ? 
11155 => put them on the phone immediately . 
11156 => manny had never heard andrews sound so authoritative . 
11157 => oh settle down carl , like i said ive got nothing to hide . 
11158 => manny , golldarnit , listen to me , please . 
11159 => whoever is there , put them on the phone , now , do it ! 
11160 => manny had also never heard carl andrews with such gusto , so he handed the phone to deputy conner . 
11161 => its for you . 
11162 => this is carl andrews , mr 
11163 => andersons attorney , would you please identify yourself ? 
11164 => my name is carrie conner , mr 
11165 => andrews . 
11166 => and you are an officer of the court ? 
11167 => yes , deputy carrie conners , county sheriffs office . 
11168 => deputy conner , quit what youre doing , and stand back , until i get there . 
11169 => i am manny andersons legal council . 
11170 => do you understand ? 
11171 => mr 
11172 => anderson gave his permission , and i stop what you are doing , now , and give the phone back to mr 
11173 => anderson , now deputy . 
11174 => carrie reluctantly handed the phone to manny . 
11175 => manny listen to me good . 
11176 => do not say another thing until i get there , and get her away from that computer . 
11177 => carl , youre over reacting manny , shut up and listen to me , carl interrupted . 
11178 => dont take any chances with those people . 
11179 => dont say another thing until i get there . 
11180 => itll be about fifteen minutes . 
11181 => you got me ? 
11182 => if you think its important carl . 
11183 => you never know , but just to be safe . 
11184 => carl hung up . 
11185 => well , you heard my attorney , the partys over , manny said , gesturing with his thumb for her to get up from the computer . 
11186 => * well , are you going to invite me in ? 
11187 => carl andrews asked standing at mannys front door . 
11188 => oh sorry carl , im just numb . 
11189 => things are spiraling out of control . 
11190 => thats why im here manny . 
11191 => its like i told you , i have nothing to hide , why should i need a lawyer ? 
11192 => to keep it that way . 
11193 => i contacted that detective swenson on my way here , hes really tight lipped . 
11194 => i think they are looking for a connection to you and some guy in arizona . 
11195 => want to tell me the story ? 
11196 => manny explained the situation as detailed as he could . 
11197 => when he finished carl thought for a moment . 
11198 => i think you should do the following , manny . 
11199 => i know a sharp young lawyer in minneapolis , just got out of the prosecutors office . 
11200 => hold on carl . 
11201 => i thought you were interested in saving my bacon , now youre telling me about someone else . 
11202 => manny , im not a criminal lawyer , but i know enough to know when you need some good protection . 
11203 => believe me , the sheriffs department is going to be up your butt with a microscope , and you need someone to make sure that whatever they find is justified . 
11204 => you have no idea how out of control these investigations can get , especially if someone is out to make a name . 
11205 => you need someone to make sure that they cross their tees and dot their is . 
11206 => swenson wants a meeting with you tomorrow afternoon , after five . 
11207 => im sick of that guy , manny proclaimed . 
11208 => look manny , hes in charge right now and hes fired up , so play his game , at least until we know what he thinks . 
11209 => i guess . 
11210 => good , i suggested we meet here at your house . 
11211 => youll be more comfortable , and it makes it look like you have nothing to hide , at least here . 
11212 => thanks carl , i have nothing to hide period . 
11213 => you know what i mean . 
11214 => is there anything in that computer ? 
11215 => the one here ? 
11216 => yes , the one youve been working on ? 
11217 => i dont know , i dont know much about no , no , i mean is there anything youve put in there , any work youve done that you dont want anybody to see ? 
11218 => no . 
11219 => good , swenson wants the machine , and if its clean , id give it to them . 
11220 => hey , they can have it . 
11221 => i dont know how to do anything with it , and theyll see that i was only working billys life , like i said . 
11222 => good , thats good , it will show swenson that youve been square with him . 
11223 => chapter 27 the next afternoon , late , it was getting dark outside , and manny , carl , detective swenson , officers auburn and conners were all gathered in mannys kitchen , discussing the case . 
11224 => we contacted yuma , pd and they went to eddy cranes home , but he wasnt there , can you imagine ? 
11225 => swenson was chuckling . 
11226 => they got lucky because a neighbor told them eddy went to minnesota . 
11227 => the neighbor said eddy had called all disappointed and was coming home later that day . 
11228 => we checked the flights and got lucky again . 
11229 => eddy was apprehended in the phoenix airport at his connection to yuma . 
11230 => thats great , good work swenson , carl andrews cheered . 
11231 => yeah , cassey will be very happy , manny added . 
11232 => i cant tell you h ive got a problem , manny , swenson interrupted . 
11233 => what can be wrong , you got crane ? 
11234 => andrews asked . 
11235 => yeah , weve got crane , swenson said , and crane was in a motel in alexandria , but but what ? 
11236 => what the hell else do you need ? 
11237 => my god , the man came all the way from yuma arizona , to do what ? 
11238 => andrews was getting flustered , and using profanity . 
11239 => i dont know , but he has a story , and mr 
11240 => anderson , swenson looked to manny , he has no dog bites , like i told you last night . 
11241 => what the hell has that got to do with anything ? 
11242 => manny shouted . 
11243 => mr 
11244 => anderson , manny , whoever was out there on that road with your wife left a blood trail from your suv to his vehicle . 
11245 => the blood on georges teeth , and that blood trail , match types . 
11246 => well get a better analysis later , but for now the main thing is , we know that your dog did some serious damage to whoever attacked your wife . 
11247 => i went to phoenix and i saw that edward crane has no wounds matching a dog bite . 
11248 => what are we supposed to make of that ? 
11249 => i dont know , how could he possibly be hiding that ? 
11250 => manny asked . 
11251 => he cant manny , he was examined by doctors , and i saw him in person , and i repeat , there are no dog bite wounds anywhere on that mans body , period . 
11252 => we have a problem . 
11253 => then what the hell was he doing in alexandria , fifty minutes from here ? 
11254 => have you considered an accomplice ? 
11255 => yes , were working on that , but eddy is not to sharp . 
11256 => he could be easily led , swenson used an accusatory tone , looking straight at manny . 
11257 => eddy says he first got a call from an investigator . 
11258 => this investigator said that his va benefits might be jeopardized . 
11259 => a senator from minnesota was involved , pushing for an inquiry . 
11260 => then he said he got another call , a different man . 
11261 => this man said that he was the same man that spoke to him in person , days before , offered him money for his story . 
11262 => know anything about this manny ? 
11263 => that would be me , manny confessed which one would you be , manny ? 
11264 => weve got a few characters in this plot . 
11265 => im the one that called the senator . 
11266 => who called eddy crane ? 
11267 => not me , manny said defensively . 
11268 => youre not leveling with me , mr 
11269 => anderson , swenson said cynically . 
11270 => yes i am ! 
11271 => i called mr 
11272 => crane on his military record . 
11273 => hes a liar , and i was going to do something about it . 
11274 => you did call him then ? 
11275 => no , no , a figure of speech . 
11276 => i saw mr 
11277 => crane a week ago , in person , in front of his home in yuma . 
11278 => have you checked him out , hes a double murderer ? 
11279 => i told you that in the car . 
11280 => we know all about mr 
11281 => crane , dont trouble yourself about that , but the problem is , mr 
11282 => crane doesnt appear to be involved in this . 
11283 => what about accomplishes , somebody with him ? 
11284 => were working that now , but it doesnt look good . 
11285 => eddy says he got a call from that other man , asking him to come to minnesota , to come and discuss a resolution to his problem . 
11286 => eddy crane remembers you , manny , coming to his house , but he cant say if the voice on the phone either time was you . 
11287 => and trust me manny , were looking for any connections to eddys itinerary . 
11288 => so far , theres no other person , flight , rental car , hotel , etc 
11289 => , in alexandria that doesnt fit . 
11290 => same for a radius out fifty miles . 
11291 => you know , for the accomplice youre hoping for , but manny , so far nothing . 
11292 => eddys still screaming that hes been framed . 
11293 => you know , he did nothing to hide the minnesota trip . 
11294 => makes it look like hes telling the truth . 
11295 => and phone records from eddys house show he got one call from minnesota and two from new york , prior to going to alexandria , swenson continued . 
11296 => pay phones in the new york airport , the same day as your flight to new york , manny . 
11297 => it wasnt me , i never called crane , manny declared . 
11298 => then who did ? 
11299 => swenson questioned . 
11300 => how should i know ! 
11301 => manny answered , incredulously , annoyed . 
11302 => click , the detective made the sound in his cheek . 
11303 => you know , im pretty new at all this . 
11304 => swenson looked manny directly in the eyes , boring in as he continued . 
11305 => only been here , doing this about three years now , but you know what manny ? 
11306 => what ? 
11307 => manny responded , holding the detectives stare . 
11308 => ive got this tremendous training , and all this high tech stuff to fool with swenson hesitated , still looking manny down . 
11309 => get to the point detective , manny interrupted . 
11310 => very well , manny . 
11311 => swenson looked away . 
11312 => i will find out what happened , yes i will . 
11313 => anything you want to tell me ? 
11314 => yeah , find out who the hell attacked my wife ! 
11315 => did you have anything to do with it ? 
11316 => the detective asked the question slow and deliberate , looking out the window . 
11317 => mr 
11318 => anderson ? 
11319 => i definitely did not ! 
11320 => manny said equally as planned . 
11321 => and i do not appreciate you alienating my family from me , detective . 
11322 => i know my job is supposed to be only solving crimes , swenson turned back to manny , but sometimes i dabble in crime prevention too , call it a hobby if you want . 
11323 => this guy thinks hes a tv cop , playing the role of a lifetime . 
11324 => hopes i might possibly be involved , and is going for the throat , just like prime time . 
11325 => manny thought , then fired off . 
11326 => hey swenson , tell me , who do you want to play you in the movie ? 
11327 => any nordic hunks moving on up , or do you figure this will be the launching role for some new face ? 
11328 => i take my job serious , mr 
11329 => anderson . 
11330 => not serious enough detective . 
11331 => if you did a little local investigating you would find that cassey and i are happy together . 
11332 => shes the soul mate in my life . 
11333 => do you have one of those detective ? 
11334 => people can change mr 
11335 => anderson . 
11336 => you have been doing a lot of unwarranted traveling lately . 
11337 => no telling what has caught your interest lately . 
11338 => you didnt answer my question . 
11339 => do you understand what a soul mate is . 
11340 => its not relevant to my investigation . 
11341 => youre doing a wonderful job detective swenson , youre right on top of our transition into the age of robotics , with gratuitous distinction . 
11342 => the detective finally had no answer , looking at manny formulating . 
11343 => jesus , finally confused the bugger . 
11344 => i wonder what they feed these bastards . 
11345 => man , i was wondering if his dogma was iron clad , or what , scary shit . 
11346 => manny decided to keep the advantage , saying nothing . 
11347 => im just doing my job . 
11348 => swenson finally said , leaving the advantage in mannys court . 
11349 => good detective ! 
11350 => im only defending myself , so you dont end up wasting your time , coppice ? 
11351 => can you appreciate that ? 
11352 => i will explore all the possibilities , sir . 
11353 => friggin didnt work for more than a second . 
11354 => got to give this guy credit , if i was guilty the only thing to do now would be to confess and beg for mercy . 
11355 => detective , i have no doubt that you will get your man , manny said honestly . 
11356 => i think i already have . 
11357 => deputy conners , swenson turned to her , would you inform mr 
11358 => anderson of your discovery . 
11359 => yes , i went through your computer mr 
11360 => anderson , and i cant find any files pertaining to this billy palmer , deputy conner said . 
11361 => well , deputy , there is nothing in there about billy , just his writing . 
11362 => there is nothing about billy palmer or anything he wrote in that computer , mr 
11363 => anderson . 
11364 => deputy , listen to what i say . 
11365 => he wrote a story called timtown . 
11366 => its the story that is in the computer , not anything about billy , per say . 
11367 => im sorry , sir , but that information is also missing . 
11368 => that cant be , how would it be missing ? 
11369 => that is what i would like to ask you , manny ? 
11370 => piped up swenson . 
11371 => swenson , i know nothing about them machines . 
11372 => manny said , pointing at the computer . 
11373 => the only thing i could be guilty of would be losing information , not getting rid of it . 
11374 => i only know what the deputy has told me , and she guarantees me that the files were removed . 
11375 => geez , what next ? 
11376 => manny said flustered , throwing up his arms . 
11377 => have you talked to my wife ? 
11378 => she says the files were there , and she didnt erase them , deputy conner said . 
11379 => people , manny pleaded , i can turn that thing on , i can open the files , sometimes , and thats it , believe me . 
11380 => i only use two fingers to type ! 
11381 => youre a smart man , manny , but youre not much good at playing dumb , swenson added . 
11382 => whos playing . 
11383 => manny said , turning and leaving the room . 
11384 => you can all show yourselves out . 
11385 => chapter 28 the house was empty , and manny was nursing a drink , trying to calm down after the episode with detective swenson . 
11386 => the phone rang , manny grabbed it quickly , hoping to talk to cassey . 
11387 => i hoped youd come to your senses ? 
11388 => manny said breathlessly . 
11389 => geez manny , im sorry , this is tom . 
11390 => tom , tom , oh tom , sorry , ive had a hell of a bad day , sorry . 
11391 => manny recognized gwens husband . 
11392 => so ive heard . 
11393 => gwens mother called , said there was something in the paper about you and some attempted murder . 
11394 => yeah . 
11395 => i dont understand ? 
11396 => i was going to call some old friends up there , but decided to call you first , find out whats happening . 
11397 => i appreciate that . 
11398 => . 
11399 => . 
11400 => manny hesitated , trying to figure out how to explain the situation . 
11401 => its a mess , and its my fault . 
11402 => whats going on ? 
11403 => oh , did you know , billy was married once ? 
11404 => no , i didnt . 
11405 => when was this ? 
11406 => twenty years ago . 
11407 => she was murdered ? 
11408 => not there in minnesota ? 
11409 => no , but the man that did it , well i found him , and did a very stupid thing , and its come back to haunt me . 
11410 => i guess . 
11411 => i heard that you and cassey split up . 
11412 => yeah , for the moment cassey is not my biggest fan . 
11413 => gwens called up there . 
11414 => according to what shes hearing , you turned out to be a real asshole . 
11415 => thats putting it mildly . 
11416 => manny , what the hell did you do ? 
11417 => i didnt do anything , but im looking really guilty right now . 
11418 => i cant figure out if its circumstantial or if i was maybe set up . 
11419 => why would somebody set you up ? 
11420 => what do you have that theyd want ? 
11421 => nothing i can figure , but i did step on somebodys life . 
11422 => i went and threatened the well-being of a psychopath . 
11423 => well done , manny ! 
11424 => yeah , i never figured i had much talent , but i have amazed myself with this mess ive managed to get into . 
11425 => you know , gwen was contacted this morning by some agent woman , offered her and her mom fifty-thousand big ones each for some kind of release . 
11426 => a release , whats that have to do with me ? 
11427 => theyre billys only heirs , and somebody wants to write his life story . 
11428 => no shit , who was this person ? 
11429 => tainer , its got to be tainer , hes the only one that knows about the book . 
11430 => i dont know , gwen wont tell me , something to do with a confidentiality clause . 
11431 => i assume shes going to do it ? 
11432 => wouldnt you , i mean thats a lot of money . 
11433 => this party , they paid for the rights to what ? 
11434 => i dont know , gwen wont talk , like i said . 
11435 => you could call her mother , she might spill the beans , but you didnt hear anything from me , okay ? 
11436 => i got ya , but why did you call me ? 
11437 => i dont know , you were interested in the same thing , i thought you should know . 
11438 => look , i appreciate it , i really do , and i wont say i got it from you . 
11439 => hey thanks . 
11440 => we could really use the money , but i feel kind of guilty . 
11441 => i mean , heres this wind fall , and it comes from billy . 
11442 => gwens mother is always barking about how worthless billy was and now she benefits from it . 
11443 => i dont understand that woman at all . 
11444 => she talks so bad about billy , and he never did anything to her . 
11445 => billy was cool about it all , he said it was just family dynamics , politics in the home . 
11446 => he said his dad treated people different according to what he wanted from them or thought he could get . 
11447 => billy said he figured out the old man was messing with him at an early age . 
11448 => from then on billy had the upper hand , and that was what his dad held against him . 
11449 => it had nothing to do with who he was or what he had done . 
11450 => i guess billy understood what was going on , i sure dont . 
11451 => * manny was holding the phone in his one hand , a second drink in the other , a knot forming in his stomach . 
11452 => the fireplace was burning hotly , but manny was not getting any enjoyment from it . 
11453 => he took a big breath and dialed . 
11454 => the phone rang . 
11455 => oh , come on , somebody be there . 
11456 => the phone picked up on the fifth ring . 
11457 => oh thank god , donny , maybe hell talk to me ? 
11458 => hey trooper , hows it going ? 
11459 => hey dad , what the hell is going on ? 
11460 => moms all weirded out . 
11461 => im trying to feel her out , find out whats eating at her , but i dont know if shes really mad at you or just mad about george , and shes scared . 
11462 => i talked to this detective . 
11463 => dear mr 
11464 => swenson . 
11465 => yeah , hes an asshole . 
11466 => sounds like hes really got it in for you . 
11467 => what the hell is his problem ? 
11468 => hes convinced im a bad person . 
11469 => sounds like it . 
11470 => hes got investigator on the brain and cant see the forest for the trees . 
11471 => dont worry though , hell sort it all out . 
11472 => you think ? 
11473 => well , if anything , hell probably burn himself out trying to stick it to you . 
11474 => his type always does . 
11475 => thanks for the support , but im burning down along with him . 
11476 => hang in there dad , danny and i know you didnt have anything to do with it . 
11477 => what does your mother think ? 
11478 => shes just really confused right now . 
11479 => she keeps saying she worked hard for her happiness and deserves to enjoy it . 
11480 => she admits shes being selfish . 
11481 => she wants revenge for george though . 
11482 => ive never seen her so ticked off before . 
11483 => she really liked that big hound . 
11484 => yeah , george was her buddy and he died saving her . 
11485 => hes become almost mythical to mom . 
11486 => but , like i said , i know you had nothing to do with it . 
11487 => maybe somebodys out to get you and mom ? 
11488 => what for ? 
11489 => manny didnt reveal his suspicions because they were too vague yet . 
11490 => there are some seriously screwed up people in this world dad , they dont need much of a reason . 
11491 => you and mom have been so close , maybe someones jealous . 
11492 => i just cant imagine why , manny said , thinking , try greedy . 
11493 => jealousy can be ugly , donny sighed . 
11494 => just be careful . 
11495 => ill look after mom , ive got another weeks leave coming and ill take it . 
11496 => hey , thanks , donny . 
11497 => manny took a deep breath . 
11498 => is she there ? 
11499 => yes . 
11500 => put her on the phone please , manny asked weakly . 
11501 => manny could hear a discussion going on in the background as he waited for cassey , his stomach really tied into a knot . 
11502 => the thought of her not talking to him made him ache and waiting was torture . 
11503 => shit , i havent felt like this since high school . 
11504 => since i first got serious about her . 
11505 => god damn , i havent done anything wrong , why do i feel so helpless ? 
11506 => i find out whos responsible and so help me okay manny , its your dime , what do you want ? 
11507 => cassey sounded distant . 
11508 => he recognized the tone she used with people that annoyed her . 
11509 => the sound of her voice did nothing to quell the butterflies in his stomach . 
11510 => hey sweetheart , i miss you , he feebly announced . 
11511 => yeah manny , hows it going ? 
11512 => cassey didnt sound thrilled . 
11513 => rough . 
11514 => brought it on yourself . 
11515 => i know , id just like to know the particulars . 
11516 => how can i fix it if im not sure how it got broken ? 
11517 => well , ill leave that up to you . 
11518 => i miss my home , my peace and sanctity , and i blame you . 
11519 => ill get it back for you , i promise . 
11520 => youve got no choice , manny because i wont start out from the bottom again . 
11521 => i worked too hard and i wont except losing all that . 
11522 => you are really hard core . 
11523 => manny immediately regretted the comment . 
11524 => manny , cassey shouted , someone tried to kill me , and if it hadnt been for george i wouldnt be here now ! 
11525 => ill get you another dog . 
11526 => george picked me , remember , cassey said sadly . 
11527 => how are you going to duplicate that ? 
11528 => manny didnt have an answer . 
11529 => he was quiet for a moment , thinking , wanting to change the subject . 
11530 => all the files you were working on are missing . 
11531 => yes , i know , detective swenson called me and told me . 
11532 => he suspects you did it . 
11533 => i dont know how to do that , manny said defensively thats what i told him . 
11534 => the detective said you hired somebody . 
11535 => goddamn him ! 
11536 => manny shouted . 
11537 => he ties me to everything that he cant explain ! 
11538 => its not fair ! 
11539 => i dont really care ! 
11540 => cassey shouted back . 
11541 => i dont want anything more to do with billy , or his writing , or his story . 
11542 => my life has been turned upside down because of it . 
11543 => no more manny , do you hear me , no more of it ! 
11544 => i wash my hands of the whole thing . 
11545 => cassey , please ! 
11546 => timtown , do you have a copy , one you printed out , maybe ? 
11547 => yes , what do you want that for ? 
11548 => everything thats happened pertains to that book , trust me ! 
11549 => has anyone asked you if you printed one , or if you have any , what do you call them ? 
11550 => disks , cassey answered . 
11551 => yes , disks . 
11552 => do you have any ? 
11553 => im sick of billy , i dont want anything more to do with it , please i already told you that . 
11554 => you know , that mark guy got really mad at me when i told him i might approach somebody else about the book . 
11555 => i thought it was kind of irrational and it kind of scared me . 
11556 => i dont like people i dont know trying to intimidate me . 
11557 => i didnt appreciate the pressure . 
11558 => i didnt know you called him ? 
11559 => i didnt , he called looking for you . 
11560 => when ? 
11561 => you had just left , and he wanted to be sure you were coming to new york . 
11562 => i mentioned mattie and how she had gotten published , and he went off on me . 
11563 => i got an ear full . 
11564 => then when i got mad , he suddenly became real contrite , almost pleaded with me not to tell you about the incident , so i didnt . 
11565 => he said he though highly of you . 
11566 => hes thinking of me all right , but its not respect thats motivating him . 
11567 => please cassey , the book , a copy , disks , its important . 
11568 => ill explain later . 
11569 => theres a copy printed out in the kitchen , in the bottom drawer to the left of the sink , and a disk there too . 
11570 => oh , thank you ! 
11571 => that thing has gotten to be a pain in the ass , manny , cassey warned . 
11572 => cassey , timtown is the reason all this is happening . 
11573 => huh ? 
11574 => cassey responded . 
11575 => trust me babe , its the ultimate prize chapter 29 the material was removed from outside her computer . 
11576 => someone used a worm , deputy conner announced . 
11577 => she was in the office with swenson and auburn . 
11578 => so , anderson did it that way , to throw us off , swenson announced . 
11579 => im sure he doesnt have that kind of knowledge , carrie said . 
11580 => this was very high tech , very sophisticated he hired someone . 
11581 => think deputy , think anderson , stay focused and find out how he did it , swenson instructed . 
11582 => i still dont think hes responsible , carrie returned . 
11583 => i do the suspect evaluation around here , there was a warning in the tone of swensons voice . 
11584 => when i tell you to find evidence to convict a suspect , you find evidence , do you understand ? 
11585 => even if i think the suspect isnt hiding anything ? 
11586 => yes , deputy , i decide when a suspect is no longer under suspicion , not you . 
11587 => how was this worm installed , find that out , and you find the person that did it ? 
11588 => i dont think so , conner returned with a contemptuous tone of her own . 
11589 => whoever did it , probably used a prepaid cell phone to tap into the wireless internet system at their end . 
11590 => they then placed the worm . 
11591 => its about as untraceable as you can work it . 
11592 => any disk that has anything pertaining to timtown , thats the trigger word , is automatically erased . 
11593 => somebody knows what they are doing . 
11594 => okay , so anderson is working with some smart people . 
11595 => then find the woman . 
11596 => all that traveling , hes up to something , and ill almost guarantee that it has to do with a woman , somewhere . 
11597 => why are you so certain ? 
11598 => asked auburn . 
11599 => because , he tried to have his wife killed , fool ! 
11600 => swenson criticized . 
11601 => its not financially motivated , i dont think ? 
11602 => he has plenty of money , so why else ? 
11603 => a man cant turn down adventure after his life has gone stale , boring , he has to seek out new adventures . 
11604 => anderson even admitted that much to me , i have it in my notes . 
11605 => it could be a man ? 
11606 => we dont know his sexual preference ? 
11607 => auburn added . 
11608 => good thinking auburn ! 
11609 => swenson said , excitedly . 
11610 => i hadnt considered that angle , but it would explain why anderson would suddenly become involved in dangerous activities . 
11611 => his peaceful life would sure take a hit if that got out , especially around here . 
11612 => why did he remove all the computer material ? 
11613 => auburn asked . 
11614 => that one has me baffled , but it will make sense when we find the reason . 
11615 => maybe just to piss off his wife ? 
11616 => i want his movements down to the hour , compiled , and on this desk by tomorrow evening . 
11617 => by then i want to be able to look at manny andersons every movement for the last couple of months . 
11618 => talk to that marilyn gwynn , she seems to know a lot , swenson directed the order to deputy conner . 
11619 => i dont like her , conners said . 
11620 => deputy conners , this is not a personality contest , swenson scolded . 
11621 => you keep your personal feelings to yourself and concentrate on your job . 
11622 => right now , that job is to find evidence to convict a criminal . 
11623 => stick to that deputy , and you and i will get along fine . 
11624 => do you understand me ? 
11625 => conners didnt say anything right away as she and swenson glared at each other , conners finally capitulating . 
11626 => yes , detective , i understand . 
11627 => i will do my best to obtain evidence to convict the guilty party . 
11628 => thats better deputy conner , much better . 
11629 => * deputies conner and auburn were standing outside the office , watching swenson go through the door to the street . 
11630 => what were you thinking in there ? 
11631 => auburn asked . 
11632 => i just think hes wrong , and were spinning our wheels . 
11633 => i cant see the husband being the perp in this one . 
11634 => id bet against you . 
11635 => why ? 
11636 => like swenson said , the old man has been on the road all of a sudden , a lot . 
11637 => hes up to something ! 
11638 => i dont know , ive been talking to people that know the two of them , and unless he has fallen and hit his head recently , it doesnt fit . 
11639 => im still going with swenson , auburn said with a smirk . 
11640 => im going to do a little digging , look for the fag in his life . 
11641 => that is so disgusting ! 
11642 => i hope you know what youre doing ? 
11643 => its really easy to screw somebodys life up , you know . 
11644 => fuck anderson , rich people think they can just do anything they want , and the rest of us cant do anything about it . 
11645 => ill show the rich dude what happens when you dont tell the truth . 
11646 => you are such a pig , conner said sadly . 
11647 => hey honey , at least im still a man . 
11648 => our suspect is the one thats got the identity problem . 
11649 => i dont know , i dont like this one bit . 
11650 => youre trying to tie him to the homosexual community , and im supposed to get dirt on him from the town skank . 
11651 => that woman makes it up as she goes , conner sounded totally repulsed . 
11652 => youll feel better when we nail his ass . 
11653 => no i wont , ill be sad if hes guilty . 
11654 => why youre feeling anything for this prick , i cant imagine ? 
11655 => he comes and goes like it doesnt matter that the rest of us have to work for a living . 
11656 => he has a good life and a good family , why does it make you happy to see something like that destroyed ? 
11657 => hey , hes the one that tried to get rid of his wife , some good family . 
11658 => i dont think he did , deputy conner said , looking off in the distance . 
11659 => hey stick to your assignment , swenson wouldnt like it if he found out youre not focusing , auburn advised . 
11660 => to protect and serve , conner said quietly . 
11661 => deputy auburn , didnt hear , didnt understand , or didnt care . 
11662 => chapter 30 carl andrews and a very well dressed , early thirtyish looking man , were headed toward manny , walking up the steps of the county court house . 
11663 => the county had constructed the public building at the turn of the century and the grand , old , stone structure was still serving its function well . 
11664 => it intimidated the hell out of manny on this particular day . 
11665 => manny , this is the young man i told you about , jason mcdermott , carl said . 
11666 => jason mcdermott was the same height as manny with light brown hair , a handsome face , and manny noticed as he shook his hand , manicured nails . 
11667 => he did look all business . 
11668 => hes familiar with the other sides tactics , as i explained to you . 
11669 => christ this guy looks expensive , was mannys first inclination . 
11670 => i dont know if im comfortable with this carl ? 
11671 => manny spoke . 
11672 => i think it makes me look like i have something to hide . 
11673 => manny , you dont understand the system , mcdermott answered for carl . 
11674 => detective swenson thinks hes just doing his job . 
11675 => he is trying to find the guilty party and he is allowed certain liberties . 
11676 => he can sweat youhoping you trip upgiving him what he needs . 
11677 => you are down here for questioning and please remember , you are on his turf and as long as he is fixated on you , you have to be careful . 
11678 => but im not guilty . 
11679 => he doesnt know that . 
11680 => until hes confident youre not , hes dangerous . 
11681 => my job is to protect you from him and the system . 
11682 => you say the wrong thing , and this can go on and on . 
11683 => would you like that ? 
11684 => no , of course not . 
11685 => then you need me . 
11686 => i guess . 
11687 => good , you stick to what i told you over the phone , and if anything makes you uncomfortable , stop and we talk about it , okay ? 
11688 => who said talk is cheap , with your fee , manny grumbled . 
11689 => manny , for gosh sakes , this is not about money , carl spoke up , this is about your very freedom . 
11690 => this is about being able to afford the very best , when you really need it . 
11691 => im not concerned about the money , per say . 
11692 => it just irritates me to think that this bozo cop can push me around like this , on a hunch , manny said as he pulled open one of the heavy oak doors , stepping back to let the two attorneys go ahead of him . 
11693 => * mr 
11694 => anderson , you keep trying to put the blame on mr 
11695 => crane , why is that ? 
11696 => detective swenson was half sitting on the edge of his desk , eyeing manny . 
11697 => manny , mcdermott and andrews were all seated in swensons office . 
11698 => because , im not guilty , manny defended , but someone else is , and he looks like a good enough candidate to me . 
11699 => not to me mr 
11700 => anderson , he looks clean . 
11701 => i think i told you before , mr 
11702 => crane isnt the fastest car on the track . 
11703 => i think you are though , faster than normal that is . 
11704 => i dont know if all this was in your head before you ran into crane or you recognized the perfect patsy , and decided to use the opportunity . 
11705 => whats supposed to be in my head ? 
11706 => manny agonized . 
11707 => your mid-life crisis , the reason you tried to get rid of your wife . 
11708 => she spoke of it to me . 
11709 => swenson , get it out of your head , i dont want to get rid of my wife ! 
11710 => why did you hire a hit on her then ? 
11711 => i didnt ! 
11712 => manny was getting exasperated . 
11713 => youre the only one i can think of , might have a reason . 
11714 => youre obviously missing something , then , detective . 
11715 => what about the person that removed the computer material ? 
11716 => yes , that looks suspicious , but again , i think it was you . 
11717 => i dont know how to do it , everybody has told you that ! 
11718 => were back to the hired gun again , arent we ? 
11719 => i havent hired anybody . 
11720 => you spent a lot of time in new york , a lot of hours unaccounted for . 
11721 => you want to come clean ? 
11722 => youre hiding something sir ! 
11723 => we will find out everything , mr 
11724 => anderson . 
11725 => there is nothing to find , believe me detective , nothing at all ! 
11726 => then you tell me , mr 
11727 => anderson , in your mind , what is going on , who wanted your wife dead ? 
11728 => how the hell should i know , youre the detective . 
11729 => eddy crane has something to do with it , im sure of that . 
11730 => now were getting somewhere . 
11731 => of course crane is connected . 
11732 => he was supposed to take the fall when your wife was killed . 
11733 => somebody set him up brilliantly . 
11734 => if it hadnt been for your mutt george . 
11735 => the mutts name was george , manny interrupted . 
11736 => yes , of course . 
11737 => george is the real hero , isnt he ? 
11738 => swenson leaned toward manny , inferring it as an insult . 
11739 => if george hadnt intervened , your wife wouldnt have had a chance , and wed probably have nailed crane for the murder . 
11740 => but fate stepped in and saved the likes of him . 
11741 => weird huh ? 
11742 => now tell me mr 
11743 => anderson , who else besides yourself had any contact with eddy crane ? 
11744 => who the hell is manipulating crane , thats the key ? 
11745 => manny looked at swenson . 
11746 => brilliant manny ! 
11747 => swenson jumped up . 
11748 => you see anderson , it all points right back at you , and any moment now , my people will find the connection . 
11749 => we can all save a lot a time and the tax payers money , if you come clean . 
11750 => in the long run , it will be easier on you too , after all nobody got hurt . 
11751 => you have a good lawyer here , swenson indicated mcdermott . 
11752 => things shouldnt go too bad for you . 
11753 => you fess up right here , and youll spend a lot less time behind bars than you deserve , i can guarantee that . 
11754 => why go after cassey , what would there be to gain ? 
11755 => manny was thinking , looking at mcdermott . 
11756 => look , mr 
11757 => anderson , we have the phone records from eddy cranes home in yuma , said swenson said , still on his track . 
11758 => you called him from the minneapolis airport and new york . 
11759 => you sent him to alexandria , and if it hadnt been for george , he would have been nailed with the crime . 
11760 => i know hes not one to deserve any sympathy , but neither is the person who is doing this . 
11761 => an innocent woman was supposed to be murdered . 
11762 => manny didnt say anything , he was thinking furiously . 
11763 => what are we missing ? 
11764 => you know mr 
11765 => anderson , your silence doesnt help your situation . 
11766 => ignoring me wont make me go away , swenson advised . 
11767 => what will swenson ? 
11768 => manny shouted , surprising everyone in the room . 
11769 => ive had about enough of this peckerhead ! 
11770 => manny started to stand . 
11771 => he had lost his temper , but jason quickly grabbed his shoulder , steering him back down into his chair . 
11772 => i cant figure out if you got lucky , or planned it all real careful ? 
11773 => swenson said continuing to apply the pressure . 
11774 => manny remained silent , steaming , with swenson staring him down . 
11775 => after half a minute of quiet , swenson spoke . 
11776 => what was it mr 
11777 => anderson , luck , or good planning ? 
11778 => i dont know what youre referring too ? 
11779 => manny said , his teeth clenched . 
11780 => the hit ! 
11781 => who did you hire to commit the actual crime ? 
11782 => we know crane was going to take the fall , but who actually was out there , who did george tear into ? 
11783 => ill bet they arent too happy with you , forgetting to tell them about that big , old , hound in the back seat . 
11784 => how that person has managed to elude us so far , like i said , is either really lucky , or really well planned . 
11785 => well , its simple swenson , there is no one . 
11786 => mr 
11787 => anderson ! 
11788 => swenson got up from his desk quickly , pointing at manny . 
11789 => someone killed your dog , someone scared the shit out of your wife , and someone left a truck full of blood at the minneapolis airport . 
11790 => the blood matches the blood found on georges teeth . 
11791 => there is someone mr 
11792 => anderson , someone that you hired ! 
11793 => now , who the hell is this person ? 
11794 => im losing my patience , sir ! 
11795 => i repeat detective , i dont know ! 
11796 => i had nothing to do with the attack on my wife ! 
11797 => i know george is always with her detective , think about that one . 
11798 => manny could see swenson frown . 
11799 => manny hadnt thought about it before swenson brought it up , but whoever was involved hadnt realized that george always rode with cassey . 
11800 => is this true manny ? 
11801 => mcdermott asked . 
11802 => cassey always took the dog in her suv , and you knew this ? 
11803 => yes , always . 
11804 => of course no one watching her would have realized that because george always stayed on the back floor , loved to go back there and sleep . 
11805 => detective swenson , i think we have an issue here ? 
11806 => mcdermott said . 
11807 => youve discounted edward crane because he had no dog bites . 
11808 => my client surely would have informed anyone he sent to harm his wife of the existence of that dog . 
11809 => dont you think ? 
11810 => he could have overlooked some of the details . 
11811 => sometimes this happens . 
11812 => a third party was hired , and a detail was missed . 
11813 => i guess it wasnt good planning , but good luck after all , hey mr 
11814 => anderson ? 
11815 => whatever ! 
11816 => im truly sick of you and your pigheaded assumptions , swenson . 
11817 => you do get stuck like glue . 
11818 => why thank you . 
11819 => thats what ive been trying to impress on you . 
11820 => thats why you need to talk to me now . 
11821 => i will find out what happened , how you fit into all this , swenson continued , confidently . 
11822 => manny was about to speak to try to make some kind of point to the detective , but said nothing , just looking at swenson with a frustrated look on his face . 
11823 => manny finally reverted to a shrug . 
11824 => mcdermott , sensing the impasse , spoke . 
11825 => well , regardless , i think this meeting is over , dont you detective ? 
11826 => i dont want you leaving town mr 
11827 => anderson , swenson ordered . 
11828 => is that an order of the court , or a personal request ? 
11829 => mcdermott asked as he , carl , and manny got up to leave . 
11830 => i want mr 
11831 => anderson where i can find him , if i need him , swenson instructed . 
11832 => you call my office , and mr 
11833 => anderson will be available within twenty-four hours . 
11834 => is that satisfactory detective swenson ? 
11835 => mcdermott asked as they walked through the door . 
11836 => swenson said nothing , just stared out the window . 
11837 => * you think he took the thing about george serious ? 
11838 => i mean , i dont look as guilty to him now , do i ? 
11839 => manny asked . 
11840 => hard to say what hes thinking , mcdermott answered . 
11841 => maybe it was just a bit of miscommunication in his head . 
11842 => hes going to need something a little more solid than that to dissuade him , im afraid . 
11843 => what is it with these guys , dont they ever give up ? 
11844 => manny asked . 
11845 => im tired of the onslaught on my integrity . 
11846 => i dont deserve this . 
11847 => youve got to understand the mentality , manny . 
11848 => swenson and his type are necessary , they help keep us relatively safe . 
11849 => if you were really guilty , youd be more than just annoyed with him , youd be damn scared , isnt that right ? 
11850 => got me there , manny conceded . 
11851 => you just earned your pay . 
11852 => you did well manny . 
11853 => stuck up for yourself at the right moments , put lots of holes in the detectives assumptions . 
11854 => he might just come through for you . 
11855 => id enjoy watching him gnaw some other bone besides mine , thats for sure true . 
11856 => chapter 31 manny headed for his car , the blustering cold wind pulling at his over coat making it difficult to walk properly . 
11857 => manny was being real deliberate , moving carefully on the glaring ice . 
11858 => damn this weather , i hate this slippery shit . 
11859 => the worst sound in the world , walking on the snow and it squeaks like this . 
11860 => that means it is really cold ! 
11861 => this is the worst part about winter , someday im going to bust my butt . 
11862 => manny walked past the front of his car , gliding his left hand on the hood , using the car for support . 
11863 => with his left hand still sliding along the hood he rounded the front , moving cautiously toward the drivers door . 
11864 => when hed gotten as far as the windshield , he reached out for the door handle with the other hand , half turning to face the car . 
11865 => just as he touched the handle , his left heel came down on the ice and slipped out from under him . 
11866 => manny grabbed the door handle , still holding on as his body continued to turn , falling toward the ice . 
11867 => everything happened so fast , the explosion of sound and the sharp blow to the side of his cheek didnt register immediately , but he let go of the car door handle , continuing down . 
11868 => the side of his face brushed the hard ice as he hit the ground . 
11869 => manny started to shake his head , trying to clear his thoughts , but a big drop of blood splattered on the ice and he could feel a stinging in his left cheek . 
11870 => manny put his gloved hand up to his cheek and then looked at it . 
11871 => it was covered with blood . 
11872 => * when the authorities go over and over the incident with manny , he can not explain why he rolled under the car , immediately , saving himself . 
11873 => not allowing whoever had tried to kill him another clear shot . 
11874 => the next thing manny knew hes squirming under his car , trying to get to the other side . 
11875 => somewhere in his confused mind two more loud bangs registered . 
11876 => it wasnt until he was in the hospital , and the doctors and nurses were checking him over that they discovered another superficial flesh wound , basically a scratch across his calf . 
11877 => the forensic people find a ricochet mark on the ice , just below the car door , and a dent from a bullet on the bottom of the muffler . 
11878 => they find a bullet lodged deep in the sheet metal just below the door , between the car frame and body panel . 
11879 => all the bitching and belly aching about the snow and ice and it ends up saving my sorry ass , go figure ? 
11880 => manny said laughing , sitting up on the doctors table , detective swenson looking at him . 
11881 => manny cant figure if the look of concern from the detective is for him , or the complexity his case has now taken on . 
11882 => do you know of anyone that would like to harm you ? 
11883 => swenson asked . 
11884 => yeah , probably the man who attacked cassey , or do you think i set this up too ? 
11885 => its unlikely . 
11886 => someone tried to kill you , im pretty sure of that , swenson announced . 
11887 => well , thank you detective ! 
11888 => manny returned gleefully . 
11889 => i was worried that you would assume this was all part of my master plan . 
11890 => no , mr 
11891 => anderson , it is very apparent that someone wants you dead . 
11892 => missing a little detail like george in the back seat may have come back to haunt you . 
11893 => what the hell are you getting at swenson ? 
11894 => manny shouted . 
11895 => do you think im still involved ? 
11896 => more than ever mr 
11897 => anderson . 
11898 => this just confirms my suspicions . 
11899 => i dont believe this guy ! 
11900 => manny shouted exasperated , looking at the doctor for some support . 
11901 => what is it with you ? 
11902 => manny turned back to swenson . 
11903 => i told you , the original guy is still out there and now hes shooting at me . 
11904 => the doctor didnt even look up , working diligently to bandage mannys calf . 
11905 => we no doubt have a real professional here , making sure ill be fit and healthy so they wont have to carry me up to the gallows . 
11906 => ill be able to make it all on my own , manny thought , watching the doctor . 
11907 => yes , mr 
11908 => anderson , the case has taken a nasty turn , swenson said , a little hesitation caught manny off guard . 
11909 => he almost thought the detective was sympathizing , until he added , for you because pissed off accomplices can be quite dangerous , swenson continued , as you just found out . 
11910 => the original crime was botched , and now whoever you hired is trying to cover their tracks . 
11911 => you see , mr 
11912 => anderson , you should have told me who you hired , and all this could have been prevented . 
11913 => you nearly died because of your stubbornness to do the right thing . 
11914 => swenson had a little patronizing smirk on his face . 
11915 => wheres crane , are you looking for him ? 
11916 => manny asked . 
11917 => already found him , swenson came back . 
11918 => hes still in yuma , right there at home . 
11919 => i just got off the phone with the locals . 
11920 => look mr 
11921 => anderson , weve checked eddy crane out . 
11922 => we gave him a real close look after the incident with your wife , and i can tell you , he never was a gun person , never shot guns . 
11923 => his brother said he was afraid of them , and afraid of everything . 
11924 => crane even tried to go to a survival school , one of those white supremacist things a few years back . 
11925 => they had a part on sniper training , and eddy crane couldnt hit a bull in the ass with a spade . 
11926 => he was remembered , real clearly , as a complete incompetent with a gun . 
11927 => theres your connection . 
11928 => crane met someone there , and hes the one thats hiring people , manny surmised . 
11929 => no mr 
11930 => anderson , no way , because eddy made no friends there . 
11931 => he wasnt too well liked , and he came off as an insignificant wannabe . 
11932 => they just wanted his money . 
11933 => im sure of all this information because there was a government plant in the group . 
11934 => ill bet youre real sorry the sob missed ! 
11935 => no , mr 
11936 => anderson , that would spoil my fun . 
11937 => you think youre going to get away , and im just as sure youre not . 
11938 => did they break the mold after they cast you ? 
11939 => insults are not in your best interest , mr 
11940 => anderson . 
11941 => you are something else detective ! 
11942 => youre determined to ruin my life and youre concerned with insults . 
11943 => youre trying your very best to malign me with my family , my friends , and you dont like me criticizing your methods . 
11944 => when this is over are you threatening me , mr 
11945 => anderson ? 
11946 => swenson was quick to cut manny off . 
11947 => it sounds like he is , and ill be right there helping him out , anyway i can , mcdermott exclaimed , stepping out from behind the screen in the emergency room . 
11948 => carl andrews was right behind him . 
11949 => until you have more than just suppositions , detective , youd better take a look at all the possibilities . 
11950 => are you making suggestions on how to do my job ? 
11951 => yes , detective , i am . 
11952 => i played on your side of the fence too , you know , and youre getting off base . 
11953 => when mr 
11954 => anderson is found innocent , your methods will come back to haunt you . 
11955 => okay , mr 
11956 => anderson , im going to give you my undivided attention , swenson announced . 
11957 => lets look at everything again , from your perspective this time , and see what were overlooking . 
11958 => fair enough ? 
11959 => my god swenson , you do have a circulatory system , manny snipped . 
11960 => enough of the smart ass stuff , manny , the man is willing to listen , andrews said . 
11961 => my gosh carl , you used a bad word there , manny laughed . 
11962 => manny , youll never change , carl returned . 
11963 => gentlemen , manny says hes innocent and i believe him , mcdermott added . 
11964 => why does he look so bad to the detective here ? 
11965 => thats what we need to know ? 
11966 => when did this all start ? 
11967 => swenson asked . 
11968 => i guess , billy palmer , manny answered . 
11969 => what does he have to do with all this ? 
11970 => i presume hes the vietnam vet your wife told me about ? 
11971 => swenson asked . 
11972 => yes , we went to his funeral , and i decided to look into his life , manny replied . 
11973 => why ? 
11974 => swenson asked . 
11975 => andrews can explain it , manny stated . 
11976 => im not sure i think the same as you do , manny . 
11977 => i dont see any mystery about what happened to billy , carl returned . 
11978 => just tell me about this palmer , the detective said . 
11979 => we grew up with billy , carl said . 
11980 => he was a kind of a rouge , even before the war . 
11981 => he went off to vietnam and when he came back , he just didnt click anymore . 
11982 => he was sort of a loose cannon . 
11983 => we couldnt , or wouldnt accept him after he came back . 
11984 => i think we were jealous of him , manny added . 
11985 => manny ended up with his girlfriend , married her , andrews added . 
11986 => the present mrs 
11987 => anderson ? 
11988 => swenson asked . 
11989 => the one and only , manny responded . 
11990 => the one i still love . 
11991 => how did this palmer take it , i mean you stealing his girl ? 
11992 => swenson asked . 
11993 => i didnt steal her . 
11994 => billy was gone , and cassey and i had been friends before and we just got together . 
11995 => billy wasnt all that shook up about it . 
11996 => humm , billy palmer , the ex-boyfriend , the ex-vet , you sure hes really dead ? 
11997 => swenson asked . 
11998 => it was an open casket , it was billy , manny said . 
11999 => how did he die ? 
12000 => swenson asked . 
12001 => im not sure , they just shipped the body back . 
12002 => the veterans administration paid for the funeral and i guess he was given a plot back here . 
12003 => he was a disabled vet , then ? 
12004 => swenson commented . 
12005 => yes , and decorated , added manny added . 
12006 => i didnt know that ? 
12007 => andrews said . 
12008 => you knew that he had been wounded ? 
12009 => manny said . 
12010 => yeah , carl said . 
12011 => first thing i heard , just after it happened , was he had lost an arm , but that was false . 
12012 => he came back in perfect health . 
12013 => i found out he was highly decorated , manny said . 
12014 => i had no idea , carl said . 
12015 => i imagine , because he never said too much about his experiences . 
12016 => most of those guys dont , swenson commented . 
12017 => ill look into this palmer character , what next ? 
12018 => geez , i dont know ? 
12019 => manny said . 
12020 => the time line , mr 
12021 => anderson , what did you do after the funeral ? 
12022 => i got on the phone and the computer , tried to find information about him , about his life . 
12023 => i thought you werent computer literate , swenson said suspiciously . 
12024 => im not , but cassey led me through the whole thing . 
12025 => i can still just barely turn the damn thing on . 
12026 => im still not comfortable with that , go on , swenson added . 
12027 => i contacted his sister , she wasnt to upset about his death . 
12028 => his family didnt have much to do with him , especially after the war . 
12029 => why was that ? 
12030 => swenson asked . 
12031 => im not really sure , he was sort of the black sheep . 
12032 => yeah , even when we were kids , billy sort of went his own way , carl confirmed . 
12033 => his parents never really bothered with him too much , let him do his own thing . 
12034 => his dad was okay though , but he treated billys friends better than he treated billy , i remember that . 
12035 => fathers can be tough , i know , swenson said kindly . 
12036 => did the sister have anything to add ? 
12037 => swenson continued . 
12038 => not really , she had a husband that was also a vietnam vet , but he was a real loser and soured her toward all of them , manny said . 
12039 => john campbell , i can confirm that , carl added . 
12040 => that guy was nothing but bad news , before and after the service . 
12041 => does he have any reason to fit into this ? 
12042 => swenson asked . 
12043 => i doubt it , the last time i heard he was serving fifteen to twenty-five . 
12044 => beat up his new wife , really bad , carl said . 
12045 => he still in ? 
12046 => swenson asked . 
12047 => i think so , carl said . 
12048 => where next ? 
12049 => swenson asked . 
12050 => i found the guy billy served with in vietnam , manny said . 
12051 => one guy , he must have had more than one buddy over there ? 
12052 => swenson said . 
12053 => yeah , but one in particular because billy was a sniper , this guy was his partner , manny explained . 
12054 => a sniper , what branch of the service was he in ? 
12055 => swenson asked . 
12056 => marines . 
12057 => a marine sniper ! 
12058 => swenson exclaimed . 
12059 => when was he over there ? 
12060 => sixty-six , sixty-seven , im not sure of the exact dates , manny said . 
12061 => and you were shacking up with his girlfriend ? 
12062 => you got balls anderson , ill give you that much . 
12063 => and you said he was highly decorated ? 
12064 => he have any trouble in the marines ? 
12065 => no , he was solid as a rock , i saw his records . 
12066 => wait a minute , didnt you guys contact this partner , mark tainer , in new york mr 
12067 => tainer , yes , your wife gave me the number , and i have spoken to him about you mr 
12068 => anderson . 
12069 => i was under the impression that you went to see him , about a book . 
12070 => he is a publisher i believe ? 
12071 => swenson answered . 
12072 => yeah , hes a publisher . 
12073 => what did he have to say ? 
12074 => im really curious about this one . 
12075 => well , to tell you the truth mr 
12076 => anderson , hes a little reluctant to say much . 
12077 => i got the feeling that he was afraid of you , same as your wife , not that i could blame him . 
12078 => after all , he just met you , and then all this happened . 
12079 => he would rather you stayed out of his life , anyway thats the impression he gave me . 
12080 => yeah , he kind of flinched when i told him i had contacted ed crane , manny confessed . 
12081 => mr 
12082 => edward crane , how did he come into the picture ? 
12083 => swenson asked . 
12084 => i found a guy that billy worked for years ago and he told me billy had been married . 
12085 => i found the wife , or rather the father in law and went to see him , nice old man . 
12086 => eddy crane killed billys wife and daughter and served only seven years in some nut house , and then they set him free . 
12087 => im fully aware of the story , but why did you contact mr 
12088 => crane ? 
12089 => do you know the whole story detective , why he only served seven years ? 
12090 => he was found innocent by reason of insanity , and he was eventually evaluated and considered no longer a threat to society . 
12091 => and you agree with this ? 
12092 => i dont make the rules , mr 
12093 => anderson . 
12094 => he committed the crime , but was not cognizant of his actions . 
12095 => whether or not i agree is not pertinent . 
12096 => did you know how he was evaluated , what was used to determine his mental state when he committed the crime ? 
12097 => manny asked . 
12098 => its not relevant . 
12099 => he was given a full disability by the veterans administration . 
12100 => they gave a full disability pension to a man who was never in the service , and then blunder of blunders , he uses it to beat a murder rap . 
12101 => swenson didnt say anything for a moment . 
12102 => he never served ? 
12103 => i didnt know that . 
12104 => are you sure ? 
12105 => positive ! 
12106 => i was on to him , and i was going to take his pension away ! 
12107 => interesting story mr 
12108 => anderson , can anyone confirm this ? 
12109 => mr 
12110 => wendell guterraz , the father-in-law , give him a call , and hell verify the whole thing . 
12111 => i have his number . 
12112 => i would like to process this before we go any farther , is that okay ? 
12113 => swenson asked . 
12114 => and mr 
12115 => anderson , if this turns out to be correct , the information about crane ? 
12116 => swenson stopped , looking attentively at manny . 
12117 => yes detective , spit it out . 
12118 => it could simply mean that you had a reason to mess with cranes life , swenson added . 
12119 => manny just chuckled , theres got to be a made in quantico tag on him somewhere . 
12120 => and detective , one more thing . 
12121 => my wife is genuinely mad at me , and thats my fault for disrupting her life , but she is afraid because she has been told things , not because i have given her any reason . 
12122 => swenson just nodded . 
12123 => im not sure if it means he considered , or disregarded what ive said . 
12124 => you couldnt read this bugger , even if you had the blue prints . 
12125 => * i checked everything out , mr 
12126 => anderson . 
12127 => detective swenson said back in his office with manny , carl , and mcdermott . 
12128 => you seem to be telling me the truth , so far . 
12129 => im curious about one thing though ? 
12130 => yes , detective , how can i help you ? 
12131 => you located eddy crane so quickly , howd that happen ? 
12132 => the cop on the case , the san diego detective , albright , wendell probably gave you the name . 
12133 => yes , but the detective was reluctant to talk much , said he never gave you the location of crane . 
12134 => he didnt , he refused , said the case was closed , but , when i got back to my hotel the information was mysteriously there . 
12135 => its like someone wanted me to do something about him , something they couldnt . 
12136 => mr 
12137 => anderson , i cant verify your story . 
12138 => information doesnt just pop up at hotels . 
12139 => i am very suspicious of you again . 
12140 => whatever swenson , but thats how i found eddy crane . 
12141 => follow the story , how else would i have come across him , huh ? 
12142 => im not sure . 
12143 => why were you spending all that time in new york ? 
12144 => we have gone over and over that ! 
12145 => i was there to see mark tainer because he was interested in billy and his writing . 
12146 => mr 
12147 => tainer confirms that you met with him , but says the writing was not the entire reason . 
12148 => he says its not very good , but you spent a lot more time there in the city than he verifies . 
12149 => what were you doing the rest of the time ? 
12150 => manny sat forward quickly . 
12151 => he said that , tainer told you that the book wasnt any good ? 
12152 => yes , he said that it might yield something interesting , down the road , but it would take a lot of work on his part . 
12153 => bingo , mr 
12154 => tainer , you s , o , b . 
12155 => manny was silent , thinking . 
12156 => mr 
12157 => anderson , again , what were you doing in new york ? 
12158 => but we did talk about vietnam and billy , quit a bit , he didnt tell you that ? 
12159 => he said you talked , but not to any great extent . 
12160 => mr 
12161 => tainer was a very busy man , i didnt want to take up to much of his time . 
12162 => how considerate , swenson accused . 
12163 => hes concerned about this problem you have here , and doesnt want to associate with you any farther . 
12164 => he said this ? 
12165 => yes , he was very adamant about not furthering the relationship . 
12166 => i figured as much when he wouldnt take my calls , manny said , quietly , thinking . 
12167 => i cant believe he is trying to convince you he wasnt interested in billys writing . 
12168 => he said he may be interested in billys story in the future , but thats all . 
12169 => now , what did you do with the rest of the time there ? 
12170 => swenson the quantico bulldog asked . 
12171 => i amused myself in other ways , manny said , tired of the inquisition . 
12172 => i like to walk the city , go to shows , and i started my christmas shopping a little early this year , not that theres going to be anyone around to accept any of the stuff i bought . 
12173 => you have any receipts , ticket stubs ? 
12174 => swenson asked , monotone , like he was getting bored too . 
12175 => ever go to yonkers ? 
12176 => he fired with renewed vigor . 
12177 => ive got the credit card charges , they will come to my office , call my secretary , manny said . 
12178 => he too was bored with the conversation . 
12179 => what about yonkers ? 
12180 => did you go there ? 
12181 => ive been there , but not recently . 
12182 => when was the last time you went there ? 
12183 => oh hell , i dont know , maybe three , four years , but not recently , no . 
12184 => whats in yonkers ? 
12185 => a pay phone ? 
12186 => a pay phone , thats it , you want to inform me that there is a pay phone in yonkers . 
12187 => what happened deputy ? 
12188 => manny laughed . 
12189 => why do they rate only one pay phone , detective ? 
12190 => someone called eddy crane from a pay phone in yonkers , swenson stated . 
12191 => same day as you were there . 
12192 => i told you , i havent been to yonkers in years ! 
12193 => manny proclaimed . 
12194 => what reason did you go there ? 
12195 => to play golf , they have a really good course up there , and it was three summers ago . 
12196 => im not positive , but i can check . 
12197 => and you havent been there since ? 
12198 => nope . 
12199 => eddy crane got three calls from the same pay phone , same day . 
12200 => the day after he got two calls from the minneapolis airport , also the same time you were there . 
12201 => all these calls got him upset enough to make him rush to minnesota . 
12202 => i told you detective , it , was , not , me ! 
12203 => very well , sooner or later well find someone that can id the caller , im sure of that , swenson said , looking directly at manny . 
12204 => good , the sooner the better , because your diligence is spooking me . 
12205 => i keep telling you mr 
12206 => anderson , i will find the truth . 
12207 => and , i keep telling you detective , im really looking forward to that , really i am . 
12208 => chapter 32 you fuckers , its not enough that you try to railroad me for the assault on my wife , but now youre floating rumors of me being gay ! 
12209 => what is wrong with you people ? 
12210 => manny shouted at swenson who was getting out of his car . 
12211 => manny was standing outside the vehicle holding the newspaper , waving it , while carl andrews and jason mcdermott were both trying to get manny to back away from the car . 
12212 => we are conducting a criminal investigation and we leave no stone unturned , swenson said calmly shutting the car door , not in the least perturbed that his inquiries are complicating mannys life . 
12213 => investigation , your investigation has turned into an inquisition , have you seen this ? 
12214 => manny thrust the newspaper at him , as swenson headed toward his office . 
12215 => i dont write the news , mr 
12216 => anderson , swenson said , not taking the paper , still walking . 
12217 => i would think that as a public servant , youd be careful not to make it either , mcdermott added , following with carl . 
12218 => i had nothing to do with that , swenson said pointing at the paper in mannys hand . 
12219 => have you read it ? 
12220 => mcdermott asked . 
12221 => im aware of its contents , swenson answered . 
12222 => manny unfolded the paper and read . 
12223 => local man under investigation for attempted murder , gay connection revealed by the sheriffs department . 
12224 => manny scrunched the paper up . 
12225 => you had nothing to do with this ? 
12226 => nothing , swenson said , reaching the office door . 
12227 => am i missing something here , or are we on different planets . 
12228 => manny put his hand out , holding the door so swenson couldnt fully open it . 
12229 => you are the sheriffs department , am i not correct ? 
12230 => we released nothing about you being gay , and please release the door . 
12231 => swenson said calmly . 
12232 => well , thats comforting , considering that im not ! 
12233 => manny shouted , as mcdermott pulled his arm from the door . 
12234 => then how does a story like this end up getting printed ? 
12235 => im not required to divulge any of our investigation , especially to you . 
12236 => manny was so exasperated that he was unable to continue . 
12237 => manny just stared at swenson as the detective pulled the door fully open . 
12238 => it didnt seem to bother the detective as he went through the door into the building , a satisfying smirk on his face this peckerwood is enjoying this . 
12239 => he thinks hes got me on the ropes , and im going to fall apart and confess the whole thing . 
12240 => detective , manny yelled , going through the door behind swenson , the two lawyers scrambling up the rear , conferring about something . 
12241 => in that narrow gage train of thought you use , does the possibility you might be wrong about me , ever surface ? 
12242 => if im wrong , you will be vindicated , swenson said nonchalantly as he went into his office . 
12243 => no , i wont , not even close ! 
12244 => manny was still on swensons heels . 
12245 => you have done irreversible damage to my integrity in this community . 
12246 => youve entered my life , tossed around the pieces , and when youre gone , ill be left to clean up the mess . 
12247 => do you know i have to go to the next town to get food ? 
12248 => thanks to you , im a spectacle in a small minnesota town ! 
12249 => theres not a whole hell of a lot to do around here , or havent you noticed ? 
12250 => you are the prime suspect in a heinous crime , and if im right , when we get what we need , your present problems will pale in comparison , swenson said , sitting down behind his desk . 
12251 => thats your rational ? 
12252 => why , mr 
12253 => anderson , its not so bad now , why are you complaining so much , just wait until i can make it worse , save your breath . 
12254 => is that it swenson , is that what youre telling me ? 
12255 => manny was standing on the other side of the desk , his face red and puffy . 
12256 => the two lawyers were on either side of manny , slightly behind , nervous looks on both their faces . 
12257 => manny and swenson were silent . 
12258 => it was obvious that swenson wasnt going to say any more , and manny was weak from the frustration of dealing with the narrow minded detective . 
12259 => both men just stare at each other , swenson sitting back , hands on his thighs , turning side to side in small sharp actions , making the chair swivel with him , manny , still standing , was ridged with anger . 
12260 => swenson finally broke the quiet deadlock , sitting forward , looking at mcdermott . 
12261 => we found a witness . 
12262 => he rolled his chair forward , moving up under the desk . 
12263 => that can place your client in the proximity of the yonkers pay phone , swenson finished dramatically , slapping both palms on the desk top . 
12264 => bullshit ! 
12265 => manny stated , kind of rocking back on his heels , crossing his arms , looking even more defiant . 
12266 => a witness says he saw a man fitting your description buying a bottle of water in a convenience store . 
12267 => swenson was smiling , looking manny right in the face , tilting the chair forward . 
12268 => right around the corner from the pay phone that was used to call eddy crane . 
12269 => did this witness see the man fitting my clients description , use the phone in question ? 
12270 => mcdermott asked , suddenly stepping forward , drawing even with manny . 
12271 => and how did you find this witness ? 
12272 => we canvassed the neighborhood , and he is willing to testify . 
12273 => we also have a witness , a transit policeman , that is sure a man fitting your description , swenson nodded to manny , was on the subway heading back into manhattan . 
12274 => coming from the north , coming from the direction of yonkers . 
12275 => not enough to convince a jury , mcdermott said . 
12276 => enough to bring him to trial , swenson said . 
12277 => well see how mr 
12278 => anderson fares when its all put together and presented to that jury . 
12279 => you think you can weather that storm , mr 
12280 => anderson ? 
12281 => everything will be presented in a detailed timeline . 
12282 => we are connecting the dots , sir . 
12283 => auburn canvassed the minneapolis airport . 
12284 => swenson smiled , looking intently at manny . 
12285 => what for , we all know i was there ? 
12286 => manny answered quickly . 
12287 => how is a witness spotting me on my way to new york going to make it any worse ? 
12288 => did you use any phones in that airport ? 
12289 => no , i did not ! 
12290 => i guess playing dumb is about all you can do at this point , sir . 
12291 => swenson sat back again . 
12292 => i hardly expect you to come forward with the truth , not now . 
12293 => apparently you intend to play it out . 
12294 => like i mentioned before , i thought that it was a spur of the moment crime . 
12295 => that you hadnt thought it through , just reacted when an opportunity presented itself , but i can see that there was careful planning involved , and you fully intend for this crime to go unpunished . 
12296 => what in the hell are you talking about , detective ? 
12297 => manny sounded tired of the ordeal . 
12298 => a vender in the airport remembers you buying a prepaid cell phone , or rather , a man fitting your description . 
12299 => that man also bought a golf magazine . 
12300 => ha , manny laughed . 
12301 => i already have a cell phone so why would i get another one ? 
12302 => i hate the damn things , ask cassey , ask my secretary . 
12303 => i dont even take the thing with me half the time , i leave it in my hotel room because i use it mostly for messages , and i dont buy golf magazines because they are rags ! 
12304 => you can also check that out with anyone that knows me . 
12305 => you used the phone to plan and execute a crime , swenson laughed . 
12306 => i dont exactly like the damn things either , but i use them . 
12307 => deputy conner tells me the whole plan was brilliant , prepaid cell phone calls cant be traced back to the caller . 
12308 => she is absolutely convinced though that you didnt facilitate the computer part , to high tech for you . 
12309 => now youre insulting my intelligence ? 
12310 => manny shouted , uncrossing his arms and leaning forward , toward swenson . 
12311 => now were getting somewhere manny ! 
12312 => swenson pounced , also moving forward again . 
12313 => why dont you tell hold on , i want to talk to my client , mcdermott interrupted , jumping to head off manny . 
12314 => jason grabbed manny by the arm and pulled him toward the door . 
12315 => manny didnt go easily , making mcdermott struggle , pulling the sleeve of mannys jacket out of shape . 
12316 => manny finally ripped his arm free of jasons grasp and stopped , glaring at the lawyer . 
12317 => ive had it with all these shit-turds . 
12318 => what do you think youre doing ? 
12319 => jason asked angrily . 
12320 => i am sick of that guy ! 
12321 => manny shouted , pointing at swenson , but still looking at mcdermott . 
12322 => i would be too . 
12323 => jason pointed to the door . 
12324 => explain it to me , outside . 
12325 => manny hesitated , looking intently at the lawyer . 
12326 => im sick of backing down ! 
12327 => im not going to take this shit anymore ! 
12328 => out , manny ! 
12329 => jason was still pointing at the door a stern look on his face . 
12330 => manny and the attorney squared off , a match of wills in the making . 
12331 => swenson sat calmly watching the confrontation , wondering if a definitive moment is at hand . 
12332 => manny finally relented . 
12333 => assholes ! 
12334 => he shouted , turning and heading out the door . 
12335 => * did you have anything to do with a cell phone , the one he is describing ? 
12336 => jason asked , trying to keep up to manny as he stormed down the hall . 
12337 => no , of course not ! 
12338 => well , for christ sakes , dont let him bait you . 
12339 => i thought we went over all this ? 
12340 => how can he get away with this ? 
12341 => arent there any manny , dont start acting like a child on me . 
12342 => you insolent sob ! 
12343 => manny came up short and turned quickly to confront the lawyer . 
12344 => i dont have to take that from you ! 
12345 => like hell , you dont ! 
12346 => you hired me to cover your ass , and when youre thinking of getting stupid , it is my job to point it out , jason lectured , right in mannys face . 
12347 => now get your ass out of here , we have to talk . 
12348 => mcdermott pushed manny through the door that carl andrews already had open . 
12349 => i blew it huh ? 
12350 => manny said , as the three men walked to the parking lot . 
12351 => you didnt blow anything , mcdermott replied in a calm voice . 
12352 => swenson is forcing the issue , and you being innocent , are simply overreacting to his obsession . 
12353 => its like i explained to you before , the detective needs reinforcement . 
12354 => he is certain hes is doing the right thing , hes certain youre the man . 
12355 => i got you out of there because the bullshit is mounting , and im convinced that we need to change our strategy , mcdermott said as they reached the car . 
12356 => carl andrews was getting into the passengers side of the car , and suddenly commented to manny . 
12357 => that comment , the one about the witness seeing a man fitting your description ? 
12358 => yeah , what about it ? 
12359 => manny replied . 
12360 => jason , carl said to mcdermott . 
12361 => i was thinking all this was just one big mistake , that cassey simply happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time , and manny was a suspect because he was the husband . 
12362 => carl got into the car , thinking . 
12363 => whats on your mind carl ? 
12364 => mcdermott asked . 
12365 => the thing about the golf magazine ? 
12366 => yeah , go on . 
12367 => manny , i seem to remember that you didnt like golf magazines even when you were a kid , correct ? 
12368 => carl asked . 
12369 => yeah , theyre bullshit . 
12370 => and youd never buy one ? 
12371 => mcdermott asked , picking up on carls direction . 
12372 => is there any proof of this ? 
12373 => he asked manny . 
12374 => any one that knows me is all . 
12375 => i wont even allow them in my office . 
12376 => if i could keep them out of the stores , i would , manny stated . 
12377 => i seems likely that someone is trying to make you look guilty . 
12378 => someone that knows you like golf , but didnt realize that you dont buy the magazines . 
12379 => thats what ive been trying to tell everyone ! 
12380 => manny shouted . 
12381 => you sobs werent certain i was innocent then ? 
12382 => its like reading a book manny . 
12383 => you wrote it so you know how it goes . 
12384 => carl and i are reading it and we may have an idea about how it ends , before it does , but were not sure until we finish , and its our job to not jump to conclusions until the page is turned . 
12385 => whatever ! 
12386 => manny growled . 
12387 => manny , carl and i have conferred and we feel it is time to establish a defense , mcdermott said calmly . 
12388 => a defense for what ? 
12389 => manny sounded pissed . 
12390 => the evidence is all circumstantial , but it is compelling , and if they find a motive , some proof of you having a good reason to want your wife out of the way , weve got problems . 
12391 => i dont want to talk to you two ! 
12392 => manny yelled , slamming back hard into the back seat . 
12393 => this is all bullshit ! 
12394 => swenson is fabricating the whole thing . 
12395 => you two warned me this could happen , the gestapo mentality could get out of control , and now youre ready to throw me to the wolves . 
12396 => calm down , manny , carl pleaded . 
12397 => calm down ? 
12398 => fuck you , swenson and his raged band are coming up with all these witnesses that are burying my ass . 
12399 => how can that be ? 
12400 => witnesses are notoriously unreliable , jason said . 
12401 => i can go talk to these same people and theyll tell me what i want to hear , the same thing they did for the authorities , and more than likely they may be stage players , like the guy with the magazine . 
12402 => god , im sick of this ! 
12403 => manny said , expelling a big breath . 
12404 => look , its christmas eve , were all going home , carl said . 
12405 => ill go tell swenson so he can be with the kids , polish his gun or something . 
12406 => chapter 33 come on betty , what are you trying to do ? 
12407 => manny pleaded into the phone , sitting watching the fire , a drink in his hand . 
12408 => i have the right to talk to my family . 
12409 => manny anderson , youve lost that right . 
12410 => you are sinful and dangerous , casseys mother scolded . 
12411 => what are you talking about ? 
12412 => im being railroaded . 
12413 => you cant believe all those things about me ? 
12414 => youve known me for many years , betty . 
12415 => a relationship of trust doesnt just disappear overnight . 
12416 => not because of innuendoes , at least it shouldnt . 
12417 => manny , ive never trusted you . 
12418 => you and that ridiculous sense of humor , or thats what you call it . 
12419 => i call it childish . 
12420 => youve never grown up manny and this just proves it . 
12421 => how could you do this to cassey and the kids ? 
12422 => i havent done a thing ! 
12423 => my daughter and my grandchildren are hiding , afraid for their lives , and youre trying to convince me that you havent done anything . 
12424 => manny grow up . 
12425 => is ed there ? 
12426 => ed is not here , and if he was , he wouldnt want to talk to you either . 
12427 => you finally got your way , huh betty ? 
12428 => all these years of lying in wait paid off . 
12429 => im sorry we couldnt solve our differences before you were presented with the opportunity of a life time . 
12430 => you are a godless man , manny anderson , and that is a sin that cant be forgiven . 
12431 => you lead my daughter and my grandchildren down a path of sin , and i only hope that there is salvation and a spot in heaven for them , now that they are free of you , thanks to that nice detective . 
12432 => dont say it manny , dont provoke her . 
12433 => this is not a good time , the old bat has the edge . 
12434 => how can ed put up with her ? 
12435 => manny hung the phone up . 
12436 => * hey carl , manny anderson , remember me ? 
12437 => how the hells it going ? 
12438 => manny said loudly into the phone . 
12439 => manny are you drunk ? 
12440 => damn right i am ! 
12441 => and do you know why carl ? 
12442 => no , manny , i dont . 
12443 => because , mr 
12444 => legal eagle , im having a lousy christmas , manny was slurring his words . 
12445 => im sitting here at home , all alone on christmas eve , and i cant find anyone to talk to . 
12446 => since im paying you , i decided you cant hang up on me , so i called . 
12447 => hows that for a reason to get blasted ? 
12448 => does that fit the bill ? 
12449 => its the only thing i could find to do , getting hammered that is . 
12450 => what can i do for you ? 
12451 => manny , youre not making much sense , you called me . 
12452 => thats because people drink to forget , not to make sense , manny laughed . 
12453 => does that make sense ? 
12454 => no wait , people drink to wash away the pain . 
12455 => yeah , thats it , i got pain carl . 
12456 => oops , manny laughed again . 
12457 => i did have pain , but the alcohol has kicked in , and now im fine . 
12458 => of course ill have a rip roaring hangover in the morning , but thatll be tomorrow , wont it ? 
12459 => ill bet you i wont drink tomorrow , no sirry , but for the rest of this day ill be just fine , thanks to the booze . 
12460 => manny , things arent as bad as youre making them out to be . 
12461 => bullshit , swenson the savage swede figures he has enough to arrest me now . 
12462 => how much worse can it get ? 
12463 => an arrest is a long way away , manny . 
12464 => youre over reacting . 
12465 => im am thinking of getting the hell out of here . 
12466 => what ? 
12467 => carl shouted . 
12468 => dont do that ? 
12469 => you cant solve anything by running away . 
12470 => manny , please , let mcdermott do his job . 
12471 => his job ! 
12472 => whos job is it to find who the hell is doing this to me , huh ? 
12473 => carl , who do we hire to take care of that ? 
12474 => id be willing to pay him overtime , by the way , or maybe we need a woman . 
12475 => yeah , a woman with big tits , they get answers faster . 
12476 => he could make a lot more than you are , no , we decided it was a she . 
12477 => boy , just think , i wouldnt need you and mcdermott because i wouldnt be guilty anymore . 
12478 => if someone is setting you up , it will come out , carl assured . 
12479 => if , if ! 
12480 => god-damnit andrews , someone is screwing me over here . 
12481 => i know this because i am innocent . 
12482 => you hear me carl ! 
12483 => in-no-cent ! 
12484 => how would you like to be in-no-cent on christmas eve , and getting drunk instead because no one believes you ? 
12485 => put that in your pipe and smoke it . 
12486 => oops , thats not right is it , manny chuckled . 
12487 => im drinking , not smoking . 
12488 => theres where i made my mistake . 
12489 => is there a clich about getting bombed that fits the bill ? 
12490 => go to bed manny . 
12491 => i guess ill have to , to fuckin drunk to drive . 
12492 => oh , for gosh sakes manny , do not get in your car , you hear me . 
12493 => i already said i was too drunk to drive , lawyer dude . 
12494 => shit , i couldnt even find the keys , even if i had to . 
12495 => shit , i probably couldnt even find the car . 
12496 => manny laughed heartily . 
12497 => so dont worry counselor , im isolated for the evening , out of the loop . 
12498 => cant get in anymore trouble , so dont worry oh lawyer of mine . 
12499 => hey you know what ? 
12500 => there was a clattering sound as manny dropped the phone . 
12501 => manny fumbled for a moment , finally getting the phone back to his ear , but didnt say anything . 
12502 => carl can hear manny breathing manny , you there ? 
12503 => carl finally asked . 
12504 => hey carl , thanks for getting back to me , manny slurred . 
12505 => where was i ? 
12506 => youre having a lousy christmas , carl sighed . 
12507 => oh yeah , thats where i was . 
12508 => yeah , thats why im drinking , right ? 
12509 => manny , i have to go ! 
12510 => this is probably going to be my worst christmas ever , huh andrews ? 
12511 => tell me its not possible to have a worse one , will you andrews , huh , will you ? 
12512 => no manny , its not likely that youll ever have one this bad again . 
12513 => now put the bottle away and go-to-bed . 
12514 => the bottle , what bottle ? 
12515 => shit andrews , i lost the goddamn bottle . 
12516 => carl , i cant find my bottle . 
12517 => what am i going to do now ? 
12518 => shit , guess ill just have to go to bed . 
12519 => thanks for calling carl . 
12520 => manny hung up . 
12521 => chapter 34 manny was cradling a steaming hot cup of coffee in both hands , looking forlornly out the window of the kitchen . 
12522 => more snow had piled up over the night and the back yard was a white picture postcard . 
12523 => all this crap , and now a hell of a hangover to go with it . 
12524 => good going anderson , manny said quietly to himself , the ringing phone bringing him back to reality . 
12525 => manny just stared at it , not sure if he wanted to talk to anyone the way hes feeling . 
12526 => christ , someone sure wants to talk , manny said annoyed , as the phone continued to ring . 
12527 => give it up , paleeese ! 
12528 => manny shouted at the ringing phone . 
12529 => god dammit ! 
12530 => manny said , finally relenting and reaching for the phone . 
12531 => hello , im in a shitty mood , manny shouted into the phone , and i have a hangover ! 
12532 => so state your business and be gone . 
12533 => there was silence from the caller . 
12534 => come on , you called me , so dont be shy . 
12535 => take your shot , shit all over my parade , manny snarled into the phone . 
12536 => how dare you talk to me like that , cassey snarled back from the other end of the line . 
12537 => oh shit , cassey . 
12538 => im sorry , i didnt think id hear from you . 
12539 => im sorry , please dont hang up , manny begged . 
12540 => i dont know manny , i dont like your tone . 
12541 => whats gotten into you , you would never answer the phone that way ? 
12542 => what is your problem ? 
12543 => its christmas morning , my family is gone , left me . 
12544 => i have a hell of a hangover , and every time i look out the window , i visualize detective swenson standing out in the snow , waiting to take me in . 
12545 => im red pines criminal of the century , and i dont relish the notoriety other than all that , how are you doing ? 
12546 => christ cassey , i just told you how i am . 
12547 => am i supposed to gloss it over , go find my suit of armor and put it on . 
12548 => i dont know manny , you got yourself into this . 
12549 => how , how the hell did i get myself into this , huh ? 
12550 => manny shouted . 
12551 => you tell me , what is it ive done that warrants this ? 
12552 => i dont know manny , but i sure havent done anything either , and im spending christmas away from my house . 
12553 => well , come on back , then , manny said happily , excited about the thought . 
12554 => cassey was silent . 
12555 => whats the problem , you can come home ? 
12556 => we can salvage the rest of the holidays , anyway ? 
12557 => manny pleaded . 
12558 => come on , what do you say ? 
12559 => no , manny , i dont think that would be wise . 
12560 => why , what the hell is wrong with our getting back our lives ? 
12561 => we arent going to get our lives back until whoever is doing this is caught . 
12562 => cassey please , dont shut me out . 
12563 => youre all wrong about this , all of you , and i need your help , please . 
12564 => manny im scared , dont you understand . 
12565 => i dont know what to do . 
12566 => in my heart i cant fathom you being involved , but in my head , i dont know . 
12567 => i am not involved ! 
12568 => if you hadnt started this , it wouldnt have happened . 
12569 => i know , but i never intended for it to get this serious . 
12570 => you do know what is happening , then ? 
12571 => cassey said with a faint whisper . 
12572 => manny cant sense if shes cautious , or curious . 
12573 => i think so , but i cant prove it , not yet . 
12574 => manny , my god , my mother is right , i cant believe it . 
12575 => oh cassey , she sees the devil everywhere , you know that . 
12576 => shes not accusing you of being the devil , but she says you are bored , and thats the devils tool . 
12577 => you have let your curiosity lead you astray . 
12578 => yeah well , dont put too much faith in peoples opinions , they tend to follow their wishes . 
12579 => i know you dont like my mother , but i feel safe here . 
12580 => i dont feel that way with you anymore . 
12581 => i understand , but keep an open mind about me . 
12582 => i will prove to you that i am being set up . 
12583 => i need to know about the man that attacked you , please help me . 
12584 => ask swenson , i gave him everything i remembered . 
12585 => ive gotten swensons official report , but that man is holding out . 
12586 => i dont think everything is in there . 
12587 => hes holding a lot of stuff close to his chest . 
12588 => i can hardly wait for this to be over so i can dance on his dilemma , just like hes doing to me . 
12589 => i already told swenson , he was a tiny man , looked like an elf because his ears stuck out . 
12590 => probably had red hair . 
12591 => why would you say that ? 
12592 => he had watery , pale blue eyes . 
12593 => most people with those eyes usually have red hair , thats why . 
12594 => an elf with a ski mask on , santa must be having trouble keeping people . 
12595 => oh , you joke , cassey chastised . 
12596 => you have such a great defense , youre so pragmatic about everything . 
12597 => i loved it there manny , all the time , not selective like you . 
12598 => i loved that road because it was my peaceful place . 
12599 => i dont think ill ever be able to go back there . 
12600 => do you have any idea what ive lost ? 
12601 => manny was silent . 
12602 => red pine will never be the same , shes right . 
12603 => manny hung up the phone without responding , knowing there was nothing more he could say . 
12604 => right now im jealous of billy . 
12605 => his definitive moments were in vietnam and he could leave it behind . 
12606 => manny sat quietly , a neutral look on his face . 
12607 => my god , cassey and i are having our first reality check , and its on our doorstep . 
12608 => red hair , ears that stick out . 
12609 => where have i heard that before ? 
12610 => * manny quickly dialed another number and waited . 
12611 => the phone was answered on the fourth ring . 
12612 => swenson , you talked to betty boop , manny said annoyed . 
12613 => betty who ? 
12614 => and what are you doing calling me at home , on christmas day ? 
12615 => swenson didnt sound pleased . 
12616 => you gave me the number to confess , if i decided to , remember ? 
12617 => are you confessing ? 
12618 => hell no , im just pissed about you calling betty boop . 
12619 => who is betty boop ? 
12620 => the betty , casseys mother . 
12621 => that mustve been enlightening . 
12622 => shes a little bit round the bend you know . 
12623 => i didnt get that impression . 
12624 => swenson , christ , she sees jesus in her tea leaves . 
12625 => shes a christian , do you hold that against her ? 
12626 => i dont hold anything against her , its the other way around . 
12627 => cassey was raised in a house where she was intimidated by her mothers religious zeal . 
12628 => cassey never went for it and was relieved to get out , away from the constant brow beating . 
12629 => cassey has her own beliefs and chooses her own way of practicing them . 
12630 => i never have , and never will interfere with that . 
12631 => its christmas , anything more important to tell me ? 
12632 => no , i just wanted to congratulate you for covering all the bases , manny said mad , slamming the phone back into its cradle . 
12633 => * later that day , a car came driving up mannys driveway , but he couldnt make out who was in it . 
12634 => manny pulled on a jacket and went outside . 
12635 => the car pulled right up to the garage , but whoever was inside didnt get out . 
12636 => as manny approached the car , the drivers side window slide down and manny recognized deputy conner sitting behind the steering wheel . 
12637 => mr 
12638 => anderson , can i talk to you ? 
12639 => she asked . 
12640 => manny approached the open window , a peeved expression on his face . 
12641 => deputy conner , what a surprise . 
12642 => mr 
12643 => anderson , id like a word with you , if you dont mind ? 
12644 => conner said , still in the car . 
12645 => it was evident that she didnt want to get out . 
12646 => youre trying to ruin my life so please dont patronize me also . 
12647 => my enemies call me manny , he said , walking up to the open window . 
12648 => yes , manny , ah , i want you to know , ah , im not in line with the department . 
12649 => i think thats how detective swenson would phrase it . 
12650 => well , deputy , you must be out of line then . 
12651 => in that case , you definitely can call me manny . 
12652 => whats on your mind ? 
12653 => this case , whats happening to you . 
12654 => are you sure you want to discuss this with me , i mean , after all , swenson is your boss , and im sure he wouldnt be too happy about you disclosing anything to me . 
12655 => conner sat there quiet for a moment , thinking . 
12656 => i dont like my job anymore , she finally said . 
12657 => i think youre innocent and i dont like swenson , and i dont like auburn . 
12658 => why is it so bad to help you prove that ? 
12659 => i got into law enforcement to help people , keep them safe . 
12660 => i just dont get that feeling anymore . 
12661 => whats your problem is , deputy conner , is carrie , please call me carrie , conner interrupted . 
12662 => okay , carrie . 
12663 => the problem youre experiencing is that you might have a conscience , you might have feelings . 
12664 => your cohorts only remember being assembled and then packaged somewhere . 
12665 => packaged ? 
12666 => it was a reference to them being extremely anal , you know robot mentality . 
12667 => ah , i make up mental personalities for the people i deal with , you know in my head , and swenson reminds me of the star in a futuristic cop movie , the indestructible half human , half machine character , unrelenting and undetourable . 
12668 => thats detective swenson all right , but auburn is just plain dumb . 
12669 => carrie started laughing . 
12670 => whats so funny ? 
12671 => i was just thinking , you compared swenson to a robot . 
12672 => if you were to compare auburn to any machine , i wouldnt go any higher than a can opener . 
12673 => it was mannys turn to laugh . 
12674 => you mean i have nothing to worry about from auburn ? 
12675 => oh , no , mr 
12676 => , excuse me manny , hes just dumb enough to be dangerous . 
12677 => he hangs on any word that swenson says . 
12678 => hes the perfect model for swenson , doesnt care about anything but career advancement , and swenson is the top dog , if hes looking to go far , up in these woods . 
12679 => auburn is the one that started the gay suspicions . 
12680 => how the hell did he manage to get it in the paper ? 
12681 => he went out to the lake , to that gay resort . 
12682 => he figured that if you were gay , youd be known out there . 
12683 => well , im not , just for your information . 
12684 => swenson sent him out there ? 
12685 => didnt super sleuth realize it would be enough to start the rumor , or didnt he care ? 
12686 => im big news around here , because its cassey and me , and the assaults , and anything juicy is a short step to publication . 
12687 => there are reporters from the cities here , for christ sakes . 
12688 => it wasnt swenson , he just instructed auburn to check out if you might be gay . 
12689 => auburn got the flash all on his own . 
12690 => what does swenson think of it now ? 
12691 => he says that if you are gay , it will come out now , for sure . 
12692 => and now its a crime to be gay ? 
12693 => i dont know what hes thinking , but im just sick about whats happening . 
12694 => ive always wanted a relationship like you and your wife have , and now im expected to do everything i can to tear it apart . 
12695 => my husband only wants methe little womanfor a conventional wife . 
12696 => the only reason he agrees with my working is the money . 
12697 => he would be a lot happier if i was only a waitress . 
12698 => the responsibility i have is too much for his fragile ego . 
12699 => sounds like you and the mr 
12700 => are headed for trouble ? 
12701 => we passed trouble a long time ago . 
12702 => i want you to know , if there is anything i can do for you , i will try . 
12703 => no , you lay low . 
12704 => i dont want to see anyone else get burned by the zealots , unless the two super heroes cross the line , that is . 
12705 => i think they did with the new york connection . 
12706 => in what way ? 
12707 => i was the one that went there , to check , to look for evidence . 
12708 => and . 
12709 => i didnt find anything concrete , but it looked like somebody might be out to make you look bad . 
12710 => but , im not an experienced investigator . 
12711 => did you meet with this mark tainer ? 
12712 => yes , i interviewed him . 
12713 => what was your impression of him ? 
12714 => kind of into himself , if you know what i mean ? 
12715 => not really , can you elaborate ? 
12716 => he said he didnt want to help us point the finger at anyone , meaning you , but he was very helpful to us . 
12717 => i think he was very impressed with how he manipulated me . 
12718 => deputy , you are observant , something a cop needs . 
12719 => maybe you should reconsider leaving the job . 
12720 => i didnt say i was leaving the occupation , just thinking of changing locations . 
12721 => chapter 35 for those of you still stuck in a snow bank , i have good news , the morning weather man announced over the radio . 
12722 => we have a warming trend headed our way . 
12723 => temperatures today will hit the low thirties , tomorrow the low forties , and the next day , back to minnesota in winter . 
12724 => ice on the roads , goodbye , at least temporarily . 
12725 => remember , its still january . 
12726 => manny sat at the kitchen bar , a cup of coffee in his hands , looking out the window , fantasizing about the snow melting and spring coming . 
12727 => but the warning , about it only being january , from the guy that was supposed to know , struck home . 
12728 => it was time to go south . 
12729 => if spring wasnt going to come to him , he would go to spring he decided , as carl and jason walked into the kitchen . 
12730 => manny , someone is out to get you , jason whined . 
12731 => you need to find the lowest point possible , curl up in a ball , and pull something over yourself for the time being . 
12732 => not expose yourself . 
12733 => hes not going to listen to you mcdermott , carl said . 
12734 => i know this guy , hes about as determined as there is . 
12735 => am i right manny , youre not about to do the sensible thing , and let the authorities handle it , are you ? 
12736 => the authorities havent made it past the setup yet . 
12737 => how long do i wait carl ? 
12738 => how long is it going to take for them to figure it all out ? 
12739 => a lot quicker , if you tell them what you know . 
12740 => bah , i only have suspicions , and i already told swenson about tainer , and he didnt do anything . 
12741 => he didnt find anything , carl commented . 
12742 => there you go , manny announced . 
12743 => manny , dont do something stupid ! 
12744 => carl begged . 
12745 => they cant arrest you with what theyve got , and they certainly cant take you to trial . 
12746 => you go off cowboying , and who knows what will happen . 
12747 => i love you guys and your lawyer mentality . 
12748 => you tell me dont worry , theres not enough to make it official , they cant put you in jail , yet . 
12749 => i know thats what im paying you for , to keep me out of jail . 
12750 => youre both giving me speeches based on your job descriptions . 
12751 => what im having a problem with is beyond that , it goes all the way to my freedoms . 
12752 => i certainly dont want to go to jail , especially since im not guilty of anything , but my life has been turned upside down and someone is using the system to do that . 
12753 => and very effectively i might add . 
12754 => considering how important my good life is to me , i think i should turn it over somebody that can understand the weight of this problem , and that would be me . 
12755 => but , manny , this is way out of your league . 
12756 => the worst thing you can do is make yourself vulnerable . 
12757 => somebody is trying to kill you , carl pleaded yeah , and i cant sit around doing nothing about it . 
12758 => you expect me to just sit and wait it out ? 
12759 => is that your solution carl ? 
12760 => i dont know manny , i just think that you could hire somebody or something . 
12761 => get somebody that does this sort of thing . 
12762 => ill think about it , but for now , im still the only one ive got . 
12763 => what are your plans ? 
12764 => im going on the lamb for starters . 
12765 => its harder to hit a moving target . 
12766 => i dont think swenson is going to like that , we promised him you would be available , jason declared . 
12767 => fuck swenson , its my turn to piss him off . 
12768 => manny , hes the law , hes got the system behind him , carl said . 
12769 => just a warning , manny . 
12770 => i know we cant stop you , and im not going to try anymore , but you stay in contact with us , you hear . 
12771 => i dont know what swenson will do , you cut and run , but if he pulls the reigns in , youd better be available . 
12772 => you hear me , manny ? 
12773 => i hear you carl , and ill keep you informed . 
12774 => if anything goes wrong , ill let you know what to do with the body . 
12775 => jesus manny , for christ sakes , stop the joking around . 
12776 => joking , im not joking carl . 
12777 => someone is trying to kill me , and im pretty sure theyre not new at this . 
12778 => what a set up , manny continued . 
12779 => i need you guys to protect myself when ive done nothing wrong . 
12780 => the system says i pay you regardless of whats right or wrong , i just pay , and be thankful . 
12781 => chapter 36 manny took a cab down to the local chevy dealer and was standing in the show room , talking to stan markowitz . 
12782 => stan and his father owned the dealership , and stan and manny had been friends since school days . 
12783 => come on manny , let me put you in this vet . 
12784 => you need some excitement in your life , stan said . 
12785 => jesus stan , ive got all the excitement i can handle . 
12786 => havent you heard ? 
12787 => shit anderson , thatll all blow over . 
12788 => i mean some real thrills . 
12789 => this baby really flies . 
12790 => markowitz had the classic salesman stance and his hands were directing mannys attention to the racy , white car . 
12791 => handles like a dream , and i promise , itll give you a new lease on life . 
12792 => probably end up killing myself , remember the last hot car i had ? 
12793 => you were a dumb ass kid then , besides this is a real machine , not that straight line , suicide , piece of junk you had . 
12794 => this is the latest in technology , three hundred pounds lighter than the regular corvette , a hundred more horses , and bigger brakes . 
12795 => this thing handles and brakes like a dream . 
12796 => you already said that . 
12797 => youre starting to sound like a friggin salesman , repeating yourself . 
12798 => manny , just take it for a week or so , see what you think . 
12799 => im telling you , youll fall in love with it . 
12800 => i dont know , i suppose it wouldnt hurt . 
12801 => i need a car , considering the old one is down at the cop shop with bullet holes in it . 
12802 => there you go anderson , if anyones after your sorry ass , you can leave em in the dust with this baby . 
12803 => yeah , whatre you going to say if i bring it back with holes in it ? 
12804 => is it that serious manny ? 
12805 => i thought this whole thing was just blown out of proportion . 
12806 => its serious stan . 
12807 => i cant believe it . 
12808 => ive known you for a long time and i dont believe it one bit . 
12809 => what cant you believe , what part is it youre not going for ? 
12810 => well , for one thing , i know youre not gay . 
12811 => who the hell started that ? 
12812 => that dumb fuck cop . 
12813 => ive never had the pleasure of meeting the prick , but ill guarantee , hell never set foot in this place . 
12814 => i appreciate the support , i havent been getting much lately . 
12815 => yeah , i heard cassey left , but shell come to her senses . 
12816 => i dont think her reasoning is all that stupid , considering whats happened . 
12817 => what the hells going on manny ? 
12818 => ive known you guys for a long time , and it just doesnt fit ? 
12819 => am i missing something ? 
12820 => big money . 
12821 => huh ? 
12822 => something big and powerful , something that could get me killed . 
12823 => still want to give me the car ? 
12824 => hell yes , were friends . 
12825 => a hundred cars cant compare with that . 
12826 => how many cars could compete with the story of a life time ? 
12827 => what are you talking about ? 
12828 => how many cars could equal the movie of the year , of the decade ? 
12829 => manny , youre not making any sense . 
12830 => what if i told you this was all because of a story . 
12831 => about palmer ? 
12832 => shit , he did his thing in the war , i guess . 
12833 => he was a daring bastard , and i dont doubt he might have gotten involved in some exciting shit , but nothing worth any cash . 
12834 => you knew him pretty well , didnt you ? 
12835 => yeah , he was a character , and he sure could drive . 
12836 => where did you hear about the palmer connection ? 
12837 => that dip shit marilyn . 
12838 => she was in here , blabbing as usual . 
12839 => christ stan , you know you cant believe her . 
12840 => i take her money , i dont take her serious , stan laughed . 
12841 => im smarter than that . 
12842 => lets hope so . 
12843 => the story isnt about billy , its something he wrote . 
12844 => his book ? 
12845 => the one he was writing , the sci-fi ? 
12846 => yeah his book , you knew about it ? 
12847 => oh sure , he approached me about it , a long time ago . 
12848 => and ? 
12849 => and the old man . 
12850 => billy told me about it and i read a little . 
12851 => fascinating story , but i was the grunt back then . 
12852 => dear old dad wouldnt have nothing to do with something as silly as that , so i forgot about it . 
12853 => does it come back to haunt me ? 
12854 => not really , unless you like lots of money . 
12855 => ah shit , i live for the stuff , you know that anderson . 
12856 => yeah , well palmer had something big , we all should have paid better attention . 
12857 => no shit , poor billy . 
12858 => what did him in , you ever find out ? 
12859 => no , and i dont know if i really want too . 
12860 => i feel bad enough as it is . 
12861 => so this is why someone is trying to rub you and cassey out . 
12862 => its that big ? 
12863 => oh yeah . 
12864 => shit manny , are you serious , or just fuckin with me ? 
12865 => ill trade you the car for a manuscript , then you tell me . 
12866 => what else do you need ? 
12867 => stan asked . 
12868 => nothing really , but im planning to take a trip , to sort of disappear and clear my head , that sort of thing . 
12869 => still want to give me the car ? 
12870 => hell , yes , you should probably get a fuzz buster though . 
12871 => if you want to go fast , they come in handy , stan advised . 
12872 => sounds like a good idea , throw one in . 
12873 => not me old pal , slightly illegal , but go see keaton . 
12874 => hell sell you one of his . 
12875 => is that guy still fooling with his weird electronics ? 
12876 => manny asked . 
12877 => yup , weirder than ever though , stan laughed . 
12878 => guys a real genius . 
12879 => i keep telling him he should go to work for some big company , but he says that would just hold him back . 
12880 => he claims he has a computer that programs itself . 
12881 => theres a great leap for ya , machines that dont need us . 
12882 => i hope they dont decide that were in the way , like not necessary , the way we constantly shit in our nest . 
12883 => jesus manny , i never considered that . 
12884 => shit , i hope keaton isnt as smart as i think he is . 
12885 => well , hes always been the guy i would figure to blow up the world , manny chuckled . 
12886 => damn , now you got me worried anderson . 
12887 => kenny is just over the border in wisconsin , ill give you the address . 
12888 => chapter 37 a quick thrust with the left leg down and then immediately back out on the clutch petal , timed with a sharp rearward snap of the right hand , and a flick of the right foot on the throttle , and the car transmissioned into second gear , the gut wrenching acceleration barely interrupted . 
12889 => manny watched the tachometer wind furiously up again , and less than three-seconds later he slammed the car into third gear , the speedometer well past one hundred miles an hour , climbing like the hand of a clock gone mad . 
12890 => the whole time the acceleration forces pushed his body steadily into the seat . 
12891 => the speedometer passed one-hundred-thirty just as the tachometer reached the red numbers at seven-thousand and manny shifted the car hard into fourth gear , the machine continuing its hard snarling charge . 
12892 => the corvette z06 was still pushing him hard into the seat as the numbers quickly approached one fifty and seven thousand respectfully . 
12893 => this time manny pulled his foot back on the accelerator and shifted into the fifth gear , but just letting the car cruise . 
12894 => manny saw a gentle turn in the road just ahead , and came into it still holding the one hundred and fifty . 
12895 => this is nuts anderson , youre going too fast , back off , youre going to kill yourself . 
12896 => a slight apprehension , as manny worked the curve . 
12897 => shit , this thing feels like its got paws , manny delighted , coming out of the corner . 
12898 => i cant believe how this car holds the road . 
12899 => i went through that corner like nothing . 
12900 => i cant believe a car can do that . 
12901 => manny watched the long highway curve disappearing quickly in his rear view mirror , a wicked smile on his face . 
12902 => thank you stan . 
12903 => to hell with all the heavy shit , i feel like a kid again . 
12904 => oh , oh , car coming , better start acting my age again . 
12905 => manny reluctantly started to bleed off the speed , approaching the coming auto and passing at a sensible eighty-five . 
12906 => oh , oh , a town coming up in the distance , i guess my fun is over for the day . 
12907 => * manny had left the highway looking for food and gas . 
12908 => he pulled into a travel center and stopped at one of the pumps . 
12909 => he went inside to pay , wanting some snacks and something to drink . 
12910 => manny was just screwing the gas cap back in place , when a car speeding down the highway suddenly hits the brakes , a little too hard , trying to slow down enough to make the turn into the gas station . 
12911 => it was just a slight squealing of tires , but enough to get mannys attention . 
12912 => he watched a big , sporty , black , euro sedan coming his way . 
12913 => the car turned into the next lane of gas pumps and drove through rather fast , the driver looking the other way . 
12914 => just as the car was going past manny , on the other side of the pumps , the driver turned to look straight ahead . 
12915 => manny saw the driver from the side for just a moment . 
12916 => it was a small skinny guy , he could make out that much . 
12917 => a small skinny guy with protruding ears , and very red hair . 
12918 => nothing registered with manny until he was back in the vet and back driving on the highway . 
12919 => he looked in his rear view mirror to check on traffic behind him , as customary , and spotted the big black car just coming on the highway , turning the same way he was going . 
12920 => manny got the strangest sensation of dread , looking back on the car , suddenly realizing who he might have just seen . 
12921 => * an hour later , manny left the freeway and drove into a city , looking for the address stan gave him for kenny keaton . 
12922 => manny used the gps navigation in the car and the place he was looking for was a snap . 
12923 => manny , friggin anderson , how the hell you doing ? 
12924 => a skinny , bald man shouted , as manny walked into an electronics shop . 
12925 => long time no see . 
12926 => what has it been , twenty-five years ? 
12927 => at least that long electron , manny said , reaching out to shake the mans hand . 
12928 => geez , i havent been called that in ages . 
12929 => i hope youre not offended ? 
12930 => manny laughed . 
12931 => no , no , not at all , brings back pleasant memories , back when things werent so serious . 
12932 => things been tough for you ? 
12933 => oh no , i just remember life as being a lot more fun when we were kids , kenny said . 
12934 => i have two of my own now , and their world is full of , as we would say , heavy shit . 
12935 => i think we grew up in the last good time . 
12936 => i guess , but we had our problems then too . 
12937 => not like today , things are going too fast , kenny commented . 
12938 => coming from you that scares me , manny returned . 
12939 => i always thought you were on top of things . 
12940 => still am , and trust me , our society is not ready for whats ahead . 
12941 => great , i should dig a hole and pull the dirt in after me ? 
12942 => nah , not you , youre smart , successful , youre safe . 
12943 => i guess you havent heard ? 
12944 => i talked to stan , he called , said youd be by . 
12945 => so you know the mess i got myself in ? 
12946 => manny said . 
12947 => stan said you were bored , and consequently blowing it out of proportion . 
12948 => got two bullet holes in my car . 
12949 => maybe somebody thought you were a deer . 
12950 => ha , ha , they went after cassey too . 
12951 => well , she looks more like a deer than you do . 
12952 => stans sure whoever is responsible has backed off , he cant see them still after you . 
12953 => thats according to stan , however . 
12954 => theyre still there . 
12955 => i saw one of them an hour ago . 
12956 => whoa , how could they know where you are ? 
12957 => stan said you left this morning , and hes told no one about the new car , or which direction you headed . 
12958 => anybody else know you were coming here ? 
12959 => not a soul , but i just started watching my rear end to see if anyones been following after the thing at the gas station . 
12960 => im pretty sure thats not possible . 
12961 => some of those guys are good , you might not have spotted a tail . 
12962 => manny pointed out the front of the shop to the low , sleek , white car parked at the curb . 
12963 => i had that vet up to a hundred and fifty , how could anyone stay with me without me knowing it ? 
12964 => someone else going one fifty , keaton stated . 
12965 => but , keaton hesitated . 
12966 => id think they would tend to stick out . 
12967 => keaton hesitated again . 
12968 => so you might be right ? 
12969 => yeah , thats what i was figuring . 
12970 => im almost positive i spotted the guy that went after cassey . 
12971 => positive ? 
12972 => oh yeah ! 
12973 => i got chills down my spine when i saw him , manny confessed . 
12974 => there are other ways to track you , kenny said . 
12975 => like what ? 
12976 => a simple transmitter , something like that . 
12977 => i went to see stan , he gave me the car , i put my things in it and left . 
12978 => how could anyone slip a transmitter in on me ? 
12979 => your things , it could be in there ? 
12980 => no shit ? 
12981 => i didnt think of that . 
12982 => what the hell do i do now ? 
12983 => not to worry sport , i can sweep for a bug , its really simple . 
12984 => * five minutes later , keaton , using a small hand held device , announced . 
12985 => its in your phone , and the phone has been rigged . 
12986 => dammit , how could i have been so stupid , manny growled . 
12987 => how were you supposed to know ? 
12988 => keaton responded . 
12989 => what did they do to it ? 
12990 => well , its got a chip that gives out the exact location , a gps . 
12991 => the satellite thing ? 
12992 => got one in the car . 
12993 => the satellite thing , kenny concurred . 
12994 => whoever did the phone , knows its position to within five feet . 
12995 => oh man , that fucker set me up big time . 
12996 => want to hear the rest of it ? 
12997 => theres more ? 
12998 => manny exclaimed . 
12999 => might as well . 
13000 => dont sound so violated ! 
13001 => you could have the upper hand now , dont blow it . 
13002 => whatre you getting at electron ? 
13003 => anderson ! 
13004 => apparently someone is out to get your ass , and they worked one on you . 
13005 => no shit ! 
13006 => so ? 
13007 => you know about the phone , dont let them in on it . 
13008 => make them think you dont know about it and thats your advantage . 
13009 => but they can follow me ? 
13010 => jesus , dip shit , think ! 
13011 => kenny yelled . 
13012 => you can lead them to where you want . 
13013 => are you really that dense ? 
13014 => ah ! 
13015 => many hesitated . 
13016 => no , but actually , i would just as soon never see those guys again . 
13017 => so then , call the cops . 
13018 => they think im guilty . 
13019 => so , what are you going to do anderson ? 
13020 => who the hell is after you , and what are you going to do about it ? 
13021 => huh , answer me that ? 
13022 => manny took a deep breath , thinking . 
13023 => i dont know , i cant keep running . 
13024 => i have to get cassey back , and right now she thinks im a big screw up . 
13025 => so do something ! 
13026 => kenny exclaimed . 
13027 => by the way , they also rigged your phone to make only certain calls . 
13028 => if you dial any number other than the one they want , you will get a bad signal alert . 
13029 => no way , that phone has been working perfectly all along . 
13030 => thats how its rigged , smuck . 
13031 => when whoever is controlling it can signal the phone when they want , and it will no longer work properly . 
13032 => and you think this is an advantage ? 
13033 => get another phone anderson ! 
13034 => kenny said , talking to manny like he was a spoiled child . 
13035 => ill give you a new one , and then work a reverse dupe back on them . 
13036 => you know , im about ready for that ! 
13037 => manny said excited . 
13038 => ive been fucked with long enough . 
13039 => youre right keaton , everyones been taking a piece out of my ass , and its time for a pay back . 
13040 => atta boy anderson ! 
13041 => kenny laughed . 
13042 => i was wondering when the old daring sven would get fed up . 
13043 => i dont remember you backing off from much of anything . 
13044 => billy was there then . 
13045 => i had a cushion . 
13046 => stan told me this had something to do with palmer so hes still there , anderson . 
13047 => do you have any suspects in this dastardly deed ? 
13048 => oh , i know whos responsible , i can guarantee that . 
13049 => well , there you go shit-head , whats your problem ? 
13050 => i was thinking you were in the dark about who was doing this to you , and now you tell me that isnt true . 
13051 => no , no , i know whos responsible . 
13052 => then lets figure out how to get them . 
13053 => youre offering your help . 
13054 => hell yes , cant let people mess with my old friends without getting in it , can i ? 
13055 => guess not . 
13056 => sorry to hear about billy , he was a good guy , keaton stated , looking out the window , watching it get dark . 
13057 => i could talk to him about what i was trying to do and he would understand the basics . 
13058 => he never called me a nut , like some others i knew . 
13059 => sorry about that , manny said , sheepishly . 
13060 => you didnt know what was possible then , not your fault , keaton stated . 
13061 => you do any work on lasers ? 
13062 => manny asked . 
13063 => nah , to big , too bulky still . 
13064 => im doing independent electron beams . 
13065 => got me there , i dont think ive even heard of them . 
13066 => not much is said cause theyre still fairly weak and short range , but theres some fantastic materials on the horizon , and the possibilities are limitless . 
13067 => where the hell do you get the funds to do all this ? 
13068 => lets just say that some of your tax dollars are coming my way . 
13069 => no shit ! 
13070 => i have to say though , im surprised to see youre still alive , manny commented with a chuckle . 
13071 => after some of the hair brained shit you used to try . 
13072 => you mean like the power line fiasco ? 
13073 => that one stands out in my mind , yes . 
13074 => whoa , my hair stood on end for a while , didnt it ? 
13075 => mandy still walks sideways by me . 
13076 => mandy , you two still together ? 
13077 => yup . 
13078 => you talked about having kids with her ? 
13079 => how did you mange if she avoids contact ? 
13080 => she figures im safe when im lying down . 
13081 => keaton and manny both broke out laughing these supposed bad guys went after cassey , keaton asked , and you say theyre still on your ass ? 
13082 => dont you worry about her ? 
13083 => shes with her parents . 
13084 => batty betty , is she still preaching the gospel ? 
13085 => keaton asked , raising an eyebrow . 
13086 => shes still around , what else would she be doing ? 
13087 => not qualified for much else , but she must be doing something right , kenny snickered . 
13088 => i would have thought someone would have run her down long ago . 
13089 => nah , doesnt work , she just gets back up . 
13090 => so you figure that gods prime agent is enough to keep your wife out of danger ? 
13091 => no . 
13092 => i hired some outside help . 
13093 => manny shrugged . 
13094 => her parents have a live-in to help with casseys father . 
13095 => hes bed ridden these days , and the regular decided to take a vacation . 
13096 => hes a good guy , but how did you get a plant past , the betty ? 
13097 => shes a sweet , old , white haired lady . 
13098 => thats your idea of protection ? 
13099 => geta gogelbright , the sweet old lady geta gogel keaton interrupted . 
13100 => thats her real name ? 
13101 => i dont know ! 
13102 => i was just told that she is an ex-operative for the mossad . 
13103 => ive been assured that she can handle herself , and anyone else that might want to hurt cassey . 
13104 => two other gentlemen are also always close by . 
13105 => christ , that must be expensive ? 
13106 => oh , it is ! 
13107 => and , im worried about the cops finding out . 
13108 => i havent told anybody about this , and if it surfaces , it will just be more explaining to do . 
13109 => thats why youre right about me needing to do something . 
13110 => dont get me wrong , id spend everything to protect cassey , but id rather enjoy my money , rather than spend it like that . 
13111 => have you met this geta , whatever ? 
13112 => no , but my son whos a special forces dude is scared shitless of her . 
13113 => you need some power , anderson , come across any lately ? 
13114 => i dont know what youre getting at ? 
13115 => power , something to set you apart from the masses . 
13116 => you think im just part of the big stupid plan ? 
13117 => sounds like it . 
13118 => youre the typical american success story . 
13119 => take you out of your comfort zone and you flounder . 
13120 => not sure of yourself if something unexpected comes your way . 
13121 => got to change that if youre going to have a chance . 
13122 => somebody is not playing by the rules you are accustomed to , and youre waiting , letting them make the moves . 
13123 => youre fucking with me too . 
13124 => no , im trying to make you think . 
13125 => thats your only other choice . 
13126 => whats the first choice , you left it out ? 
13127 => the cops . 
13128 => you tell me youre innocent , let them do your dirty work . 
13129 => right now , i dont trust the system . 
13130 => back to my option , huh ? 
13131 => kenny said with a smirk on his face . 
13132 => lets hear it , manny surrendered okay anderson , this is what you need . 
13133 => first that phone . 
13134 => what good is the phone , its rigged ? 
13135 => manny , manny , manny , we add a little something . 
13136 => you leave it somewhere appropriate . 
13137 => they zero in on it , and instead of finding you there , they find something unexpected . 
13138 => maybe arrows up their ass ? 
13139 => you still good with the bow ? 
13140 => whoa keaton , that is very nasty , im shocked . 
13141 => well , do you still shoot as good as i remember ? 
13142 => probably better , but these guys have guns . 
13143 => oh , i was just speculating , but just think of the shock value if you can get them into the right situation . 
13144 => whoever is messing with your well-being could be surprised , no ? 
13145 => i dont know kenny , i might be way out of their league . 
13146 => even things up manny ! 
13147 => you had any inspirations lately , anything spooky youve come across . 
13148 => oh thats what you meant ? 
13149 => ah , yeah , come to think of it , i had this old man show me something i didnt expect , or still cant explain . 
13150 => didnt expect , or cant explain ? 
13151 => what do you mean by that ? 
13152 => well , i think he might have been messing with me . 
13153 => tell the story manny . 
13154 => he made me see things . 
13155 => was it him , or you . 
13156 => oh no , it was me , i was there all right . 
13157 => shit manny , youre scaring me . 
13158 => you take on an eighteen thousand volt transmission line , and now youre afraid of a vision i had . 
13159 => just a vision ? 
13160 => i had an experience with a game somebody talked about too , but i did that on my own . 
13161 => but the vision seemed to be in a different time . 
13162 => a different time , explain ? 
13163 => i think i saw something that happened long ago ? 
13164 => how can you be sure ? 
13165 => the people i saw have been dead for quite a while . 
13166 => this old guy opened something for you , keaton stated . 
13167 => huh ? 
13168 => maybe he opened some sort of portal , a gateway or something . 
13169 => oh come on kenny , i dont believe in that sort of thing . 
13170 => guess you were dreaming or something , or your mind made it up . 
13171 => no , i was definitely there , and i was awake . 
13172 => then something happened . 
13173 => manny was silent , thinking . 
13174 => yeah , something happened , he said after a minute . 
13175 => can you get me a compound bow ? 
13176 => i can get you anything you want manny . 
13177 => chapter 38 manny felt comfortable on the road again , he and the car were becoming one . 
13178 => keatons device had warned him more than once to the radar the cops were using , well in advanced to any problems . 
13179 => he was heading south , to the spot he had discovered on his trip back from seeing walsh the place he stopped at in georgia and fantasied about making a stand . 
13180 => he didnt really have a plan and he wasnt sure he could go through with anything , but the feeling of doing something was lifting his spirits . 
13181 => as he drove farther south the weather deteriorated and he crossed into georgia with the windshield wipers sweeping back and forth . 
13182 => just as it was getting dark he stopped in a little town close his destination . 
13183 => the rain had stopped , but was replaced by damp low clouds . 
13184 => he rented a motel room on the main highway , requesting one that was around the back . 
13185 => he unlocked the door to the room , went inside , put the cell phone on the bed and went back out . 
13186 => staying behind the motel , manny walked to a small park he had spotted coming into town . 
13187 => he sat down against a tree back out of the light and started to eat a sandwich he had bought the last time he had filled the car with gas . 
13188 => a full moon was rising above the trees , but the cloud layer stole any light it would have contributed , leaving only a big white ball . 
13189 => the temperature was very comfortable . 
13190 => within the time it took him to eat half the sandwich , he spotted the big black sedan drive by the motel up the street . 
13191 => it continued toward where manny was hidden and passed by . 
13192 => there were two figures in the car , and manny was positive that the passenger was mark tainer . 
13193 => the vehicle cruised by without slowing down and headed toward the edge of the town . 
13194 => manny watched the vehicle until it was out of town and made his dash back to the room . 
13195 => he raced inside , grabbed the phone and ran out to the corvette . 
13196 => * manny gunned the car out of the motel parking lot , spinning the rear wheels easily on the cold pavement causing the car to fishtail , the engine winding up furiously . 
13197 => manny shifted it hard , exiting the edge of the small town in a power slide . 
13198 => * the road to the lake was a winding one , but manny could remember , it is fairly wide and the surface is good . 
13199 => * slow it down fool ! 
13200 => he begged himself as he came to the first tight turn , down shifting precisely , playing the brakes just right , the car diving down into the corner . 
13201 => hot damn ! 
13202 => manny shouted , putting his foot into the throttle , the car blasting forward . 
13203 => manny shifted quickly , gobbling up the distance to the next corner , a longer gentler one . 
13204 => manny took this corner a little safer , but when he looked down quickly at the speedometer , he was shocked to see it reading one hundred and fifteen . 
13205 => i guess a ticket wont make my day any worse , manny rationalized . 
13206 => there were a total of fourteen more turns to the spot he was headed and manny pushed the car hard . 
13207 => what am i afraid of more , this road , or the men coming for me ? 
13208 => * manny flashed by the spot he was looking for , the car in a full drift , the rear sliding out farther than the front . 
13209 => he jammed the brakes , the tires squawking as the car decelerated . 
13210 => manny spun the wheel sharply , and the corvette pirouetting in the middle of the road . 
13211 => what the hell was that all about ? 
13212 => manny was sitting in the middle of the road , tire smoke hanging around the car like a small , phantom fog bank . 
13213 => am i glad i made it , or did i want to crash , so it wouldnt come to this ? 
13214 => manny sat there watching the smoke dissipate . 
13215 => i can stay and make a stand , get this over with , or i can keep on driving , think of something else . 
13216 => manny put the car in gear and started slowly back up the road . 
13217 => if i just drive away , it will come to this again , i know it will . 
13218 => manny drove up to the spot . 
13219 => it wont end until i do something about it , he said quietly to himself . 
13220 => he pulling off the road , parking the vet as far off the pavement as possible . 
13221 => it was out of view unless somebody looked hard . 
13222 => the clouds had thickened , leaving the florescent globe of the moon barely discernible . 
13223 => he clicked on the phone and tried to dial his home number , but the phone wouldnt pick up a signal , just like keaton had told him . 
13224 => he speed dialed tainers cell number and the signal came back immediately . 
13225 => manny only got the request to leave a message . 
13226 => hey tainer , got bat there with you , huh ? 
13227 => was his message . 
13228 => manny put the phone back down and waited . 
13229 => the phone rang within a minute . 
13230 => manny picked it up , pressed talk , and put it up to his ear . 
13231 => no one spoke , but manny knew he had an open line . 
13232 => come on tainer , i saw bat back at the gas station , yesterday , in the big black car . 
13233 => you guys operate well , that car must have cost more than the rocket im driving . 
13234 => bat obrien is not in vietnam anymore , is he tainer ? 
13235 => he made it back , right ? 
13236 => you should pick your accomplishes better , or not give such a good description . 
13237 => he sure is an ugly little fucker . 
13238 => i know hes there with you now ? 
13239 => i know because i saw you and bat go by the motel a bit ago . 
13240 => still no answer hes the one that tried to get to cassey . 
13241 => how did he manage to get lucky with george ? 
13242 => that dog probably weighed as much as he does , if you described him right and i think you did , according to cassey . 
13243 => and , how come he missed me ? 
13244 => did i slip just at the right time , or was he still hurting from the beating george gave him ? 
13245 => still no answer come on tainer . 
13246 => i know its you on the line . 
13247 => yes , manny , im on the line , and hes right here , tainer finally answered . 
13248 => manny could detect a little hesitation in his voice . 
13249 => that was poor judgment , though , calling him ugly . 
13250 => he informs me that he will now do his job with extreme prejudice . 
13251 => i assume he means that he will not be kind . 
13252 => you mean you were going to kill me kindly , and now that ive objected , you will do me mean spirited ? 
13253 => im curious though ? 
13254 => now that were into the explanation stage , just what have i done to justify my murder in the first place ? 
13255 => again there was no response . 
13256 => come on tainer , give me your version of the justification for this . 
13257 => i know bat just likes to hurt people . 
13258 => by the way , bat , you listening ? 
13259 => my wife has left me because of you , and the quickest way to regain her admiration would be to even the score about george . 
13260 => not that i might get some pleasure from it myself because i loved that big old hound too . 
13261 => tainer didnt respond . 
13262 => come on girls , talk to me , manny taunted . 
13263 => youre the assholes that are ruining my way of life . 
13264 => i figured it out , and now you dont want to participate . 
13265 => you certainly are a couple of pricks in my book . 
13266 => billy was a man , youre not , tainer finally responded angrily . 
13267 => i want his lifes story . 
13268 => dont bullshit me tainer , youre not interested in billys life story , youre interested in timtown . 
13269 => you can tell the vietnam story in your own words , you were there . 
13270 => you want his writing . 
13271 => all this is nothing but deflection . 
13272 => i read timtown , cassey kept a copy , and i read it . 
13273 => its a terrific story . 
13274 => you want to steal it to call it your own . 
13275 => where do you go from here ? 
13276 => tainer asked . 
13277 => are you talking about bargaining with me ? 
13278 => no , manny , you have nothing to bargain with , and you are not a brave man . 
13279 => so you expect me to do nothing , is that what youre hoping ? 
13280 => theres nothing you can do . 
13281 => you have nowhere to go , manny , so i guess all this supposition is good for the soul . 
13282 => i talked to the police guy , swenson , yesterday and he is pissed about you running . 
13283 => he thinks he screwed up and let you get away . 
13284 => so he is hunting you at this moment , but dont worry , im not the kind of guy that would tell on you . 
13285 => the connection went dead , cut from the other end . 
13286 => manny put the phone down on the passengers seat , certain that mark tainer was not interested in talking to him any farther . 
13287 => the phones physiological use was gone , for now . 
13288 => manny waited , and a couple of minutes later he saw headlights coming up the road . 
13289 => his first feeling was fear . 
13290 => i can back the vet out on the road and be gone before they get to me , or i can stay and try to fight . 
13291 => manny feels for the large canvas bag on the rear deck , behind the seats . 
13292 => he pulls the bag over the passenger seat and it flops down beside him . 
13293 => the headlights are maybe a couple of minutes away , as manny looks intently at the bag . 
13294 => he watches the approaching headlights some more . 
13295 => this is the only way ill ever get my whole life back . 
13296 => even if the truth gets told , the truth will still be that i jeopardized casseys life , foolishly . 
13297 => both of us will always have that hanging over us . 
13298 => i need to finish this now . 
13299 => manny grabbed the cell phone , the bag , and opened the car door . 
13300 => it was pitch black outside because the clouds had thickened and the moon was gone . 
13301 => he walked to the edge of the road , snapped on the small pen light he had , and stepped into the underbrush at the same spot as two weeks before . 
13302 => he was fifty feet into the thick growth , moving down the same narrow game trail when he heard a car approaching on the road above . 
13303 => he heard bat and tainers car skidding to a stop in the gravel . 
13304 => two doors opened , as manny reached the bottom of the slope . 
13305 => he started up the hill , the sound of the trunk being slammed hurrying him on . 
13306 => he used the pen light intermittently and only down at the ground . 
13307 => manny , you fool ! 
13308 => tainer yelled from the road . 
13309 => youre making this too easy . 
13310 => i knew youd panic ! 
13311 => i knew youd be no match for us . 
13312 => but for gods sake anderson , why out here , why make it so easy ? 
13313 => you can run as fast as you like , go ahead and run , manny , you can run , and run , and run , but there is no place to go . 
13314 => manny could hear muffled voices from the road as he found the rock cap and turned left , still going up . 
13315 => manny located the small protected place from the first trip , sat down , took the cell phone and dialed tainers number . 
13316 => hello manny , tainer answered immediately . 
13317 => leave me alone , tainer , manny used a pleading tone . 
13318 => theyre going to know it was you . 
13319 => anderson , no one is going to think anything close , tainer laughed into the phone . 
13320 => you see , youre guilty in everyones eyes , and youre on the edge of losing it . 
13321 => they wont be surprised that you had to end it all , theyll expect it . 
13322 => they dont even know im here . 
13323 => besides im covered manny , no one will ever find your body . 
13324 => manny anderson is just going to disappear off the face of the planet . 
13325 => im going to do you , and no one will ever know the truth . 
13326 => back up toward the road , manny could see a light , barely showing through the heavy vegetation . 
13327 => it was making its way down . 
13328 => arent these things wonderful ? 
13329 => tainer continued . 
13330 => i mean the cell phones . 
13331 => you and i can talk , carry on a conversation while i hunt you down . 
13332 => shit , in vietnam we couldnt even carry radios , to heavy , lousy batteries . 
13333 => manny could hear tainer and bat struggling through the thick growth , they hadnt found the game trail in their over confidence . 
13334 => just think manny , billy and i went into the teeth of the dragon , hoping like hell we didnt need any help because there was none . 
13335 => we couldnt make a call if our life depended on it . 
13336 => back then we didnt have something like a cell phone to call for the cavalry . 
13337 => damn smart of me to switch yours , huh ? 
13338 => geez , i just amaze myself sometimes . 
13339 => manny quickly opened the bag and withdrew the compound bow and a large quiver of arrows kenny had gotten him . 
13340 => he sat back against the rocks and took many deep breaths , trying to calm himself , looking for the confidence he knew he would need . 
13341 => you got yourself into this , sport , and now there is just one way out . 
13342 => why have you done this to yourself ? 
13343 => why and hell do something so fuckin dumb . 
13344 => tainer is probably right . 
13345 => ive backed myself into a corner , and now there is only one way out . 
13346 => can you believe it manny , tainer started the taunts again . 
13347 => whod think youd end up in a pickle like youre in . 
13348 => manny saw the light at the bottom of the rock slide , and could make out two individuals down there , looking around , trying to figure which way he had gone . 
13349 => crazy mothers . 
13350 => shit if i had a rifle , i could at least nail one of them . 
13351 => why am i up here with just my bow ? 
13352 => tainer and bat just stood at the bottom of the slide a hundred and fifty yards away , moving the light back and forth , uncertain what to do . 
13353 => who , in this day and age , tainer continued , could imagine having their worst nightmare hot on their heels , and their fuckin cell phone is no good . 
13354 => got to put that in my book , the one i write after timtown hits the shelves . 
13355 => timtown , what a goddamn gold mine , and it fell right into my lap . 
13356 => billy would have wanted me to have it , you know . 
13357 => i was his friend , not you manny . 
13358 => not your sweet assed wife either . 
13359 => me , manny , me , cause i was the one that was with billy when he developed into the kind of man that was capable of writing that classic . 
13360 => i covered his ass when he had the talent forming in his brain . 
13361 => bat was holding something in his one hand and pointing up toward mannys position with the other . 
13362 => you had nothing to do with the billy the writer , tainer said as he looked in the direction bat was pointing . 
13363 => you and your turd friends didnt appreciate him or the person he became . 
13364 => you denied him the basic rights he deserved , the simple act of respect , the common decency to listen to what he had to say . 
13365 => he came to you , asked you to listen to him , to help him with that book , his dream . 
13366 => thats what that story was you know , his dream , his ticket to the life you all got , the one he worked for and never achieved . 
13367 => its your fault manny , you killed billy , and now im going to kill you . 
13368 => tainer and bat spread out , circling the outcrop , angling up toward him . 
13369 => manny watched patiently as the two men climbed toward him . 
13370 => manny selected an arrow and notched it into the bow . 
13371 => im going up against professionals here . 
13372 => these fuckers are killers , and ive got to do this now and do it right . 
13373 => manny took a few more moments breathing deeply , getting the oxygen , letting the tension flow out , getting settled for what was going to be a defining moment , or the end of his life . 
13374 => tainer had move to within seventy yards , shinning the light around , but not spotting manny yet . 
13375 => manny took a couple of more deep breaths and pulled the bow up . 
13376 => he drew the arrow back , holding the tension , steadying himself , aiming . 
13377 => manny had the bow drawn all the way back , taking careful aim . 
13378 => make this count dammit . 
13379 => and he let the arrow fly . 
13380 => the bow gave a sharp twang , and the arrow sped on its way . 
13381 => a second later , there is a loud shattering of glass and the light was gone . 
13382 => son-of-a-bitch ! 
13383 => tainer screamed , the destroyed light bouncing on the rocks . 
13384 => what the fuck was that ? 
13385 => mark ! 
13386 => bat yelled back , as manny could hear the two men scrambling on the rocks down below . 
13387 => i think that crazy son-of-a-gun has a bow ! 
13388 => which way did it come from ? 
13389 => tainer asked in a quieter voice . 
13390 => how should i know ? 
13391 => bat responded . 
13392 => you had the light . 
13393 => . 
13394 => . 
13395 => its really dark out here . 
13396 => oh great , tainer snarled , fuckin afraid of the dark . 
13397 => up yours tainer ! 
13398 => im not an owl . 
13399 => how did that dip weed get that lucky ? 
13400 => shit , i dont know , but lets get this thing done , and keep your voice down , youre supposed to be a professional for christ sakes . 
13401 => i dont even know which way he is , bat whispered . 
13402 => that guys screwed when i find him though . 
13403 => lets spread out , hes got to be close . 
13404 => manny could hear the men talking , but it was difficult to hear exactly what they were saying , but he can tell they arent too happy with the situation . 
13405 => manny waited , quietly , listening for a sound to give him another target . 
13406 => i hear you . 
13407 => manny let another arrow fly , directed toward the sound of somebody stepping on a twig . 
13408 => gosh dangit ! 
13409 => bat shouted . 
13410 => what the hells your problem ? 
13411 => tainer hissed . 
13412 => he shot at me . 
13413 => didnt you hear it ? 
13414 => bat said , running toward tainer . 
13415 => yeah , i think so , you okay ? 
13416 => yeah , darn near got me , though . 
13417 => bat was breathing hard . 
13418 => went right passed my ear . 
13419 => well , shut the fuck up , tainer whispered . 
13420 => hes shooting at the sounds , you dumb prick . 
13421 => great , we got robin hood two-thousand out here , bat whispered back . 
13422 => what the heck are we going to do without a light , huh , you answer me that one ? 
13423 => what if hes got one of them night seeing things ? 
13424 => well wait him out , he cant get far , and when it gets light are you nuts ? 
13425 => bat whined . 
13426 => thats hours from now . 
13427 => well freeze to death out here . 
13428 => what the hell is wrong with you ? 
13429 => i can remember when nothing bothered you . 
13430 => yeah , well , i went to work in the cities where its a little more comfortable , and i got spoiled . 
13431 => christ , im glad palmer is not around to hear that , hed be so disappointed . 
13432 => fuck you . 
13433 => bat , i thought profanity was against your grain . 
13434 => yeah , well im really mad . 
13435 => you going to belly ache , or get the job done ? 
13436 => i paid you good money . 
13437 => not enough tainer . 
13438 => i almost got eaten by a dog , big as a car . 
13439 => now were stumbling around in the dark , with a suit flicking arrows our way . 
13440 => this wasnt planned very good mark tainer started to stumble on one of the rocks , the noise alerting manny to his location . 
13441 => manny let loose with another arrow . 
13442 => shit ! 
13443 => tainer exclaimed , his voice following a loud thunk . 
13444 => i heard it , bat shouted . 
13445 => i heard where it came from . 
13446 => up there , up to the left , i think hes up in the rocks . 
13447 => did he come close ? 
13448 => lets get the hell out of here ! 
13449 => tainer exclaimed , the sound of tumbling rocks marking his retreat . 
13450 => manny stuck to his ground as he heard the two men moving back up the game trail toward the road . 
13451 => shit , theyre going back to the road , what the hell do i do now ? 
13452 => manny mumbled under his breath . 
13453 => they can just wait there for me , really smart anderson . 
13454 => manny heard the trunk of the car open , and then a few moments later another light flicked on . 
13455 => * how close did he come ? 
13456 => bat asked , shining the light back into the trees , toward where they retreated from . 
13457 => close enough , ive got an arrow stuck in my back pack , tainer answered , breathing hard . 
13458 => he sure is a lucky guy , bat said . 
13459 => hes not lucky , you dumb ass , tainer growled . 
13460 => thats why he brought us here , you twit ! 
13461 => tainer explained . 
13462 => remember palmer telling us about that friend of his that was phenomenal with a bow ? 
13463 => oh yeah , i think i remember that ? 
13464 => well , shit for brains , guess whos out there ? 
13465 => tainer squawked . 
13466 => nah , he cant be that dumb . 
13467 => theres two of us with guns , nah , cant be . 
13468 => im not saying hes too smart , bat , but hes challenging us . 
13469 => we fucked up his life , good , and now he thinks hes going to get even . 
13470 => geez , dumb smucks got guts , maybe we should just forget this ? 
13471 => not hardly , youre in this to the end now . 
13472 => tainer , dont tell me what to do , i dont like that . 
13473 => i dont give a rats ass what you like or dont like . 
13474 => fuck you tainer ! 
13475 => bat moved toward the car , a defiant look on his face . 
13476 => nobody tells me what to do . 
13477 => youll do what i tell you , or else . 
13478 => or else what ? 
13479 => that time with the two little girls . 
13480 => nobodys going to believe you . 
13481 => youre a goddamn deserter , bat . 
13482 => dont you think the military would be real interested in finding your ass . 
13483 => they get their hands on you and then check you out , and they find that most of the time you werent out hunting viet cong , you were out raping poor little village girls . 
13484 => no one cared back there , bat stated . 
13485 => dont try to bullshit me , bat , you were damn glad billy never found out about your dirty little secret . 
13486 => he would have killed you on the spot , and you knew it . 
13487 => pure white billy palmer , bunch of crud . 
13488 => regardless , we have a job to do . 
13489 => stumbling around in the dark , trying to find super suit ; thinks hes william tell ? 
13490 => yeah , well , that might be my fault , tainer laughed . 
13491 => i guess i should have gone easier on him with all the rhetoric . 
13492 => what you talking about ? 
13493 => i was kind of belittling him with all the nam stories . 
13494 => i guess the poor sap took me serious and is trying to prove himself . 
13495 => you still have the locater right . 
13496 => yeah . 
13497 => well , give it to me . 
13498 => that stupid shits still got the phone . 
13499 => i dont feel like spending any more time out here either . 
13500 => i dont like being out all night either , lets go , bat said , starting back into the underbrush . 
13501 => hold your horses bat , lets have some fun , first , tainer said , grabbing bat by the belt , stopping him . 
13502 => funs killing him . 
13503 => geez , youre sure consistent , tainer said to bat , then stepped back and shouted from the road into the woods . 
13504 => so youre the bowman ! 
13505 => tainer waited a moment . 
13506 => billy told me about you , but he never gave me a name . 
13507 => just said he knew a guy that could hit anything with a bow . 
13508 => i never made the connection , manny , but you cant hit what you cant see . 
13509 => manny shouted back . 
13510 => didnt billy tell you what the bowmans specialty was ? 
13511 => manny noted the hesitation , the time tainer was taking , thinking over the answer . 
13512 => it was the defining moment . 
13513 => no , he never mentioned it , tainer hollered moments later . 
13514 => bullshit tainer , i think youre lying . 
13515 => i think you know what i can do . 
13516 => i went to the doctor , mark , for a checkup recently . 
13517 => mark , i had my hearing and night vision checked . 
13518 => theyre both great for a man my age , especially my hearing , aaannd , i think you can put two and two together . 
13519 => i have an advantage over you now . 
13520 => you confessed to me that you wouldnt last a day in this kind of environment . 
13521 => tainer , its true what billy told you about me . 
13522 => the bowman can hit a very small target in the dark . 
13523 => ive kept up with it mark . 
13524 => all these years , its my forte . 
13525 => hey , i like this psychological bullshit . 
13526 => bat and i never got to play mind games with the quarry before . 
13527 => this has an interesting twist , dont you think so bat ? 
13528 => i like it too , bat shouted . 
13529 => manny , tainer yelled again . 
13530 => boy , you know , youre something , risking your neck like this just to prove youre a man . 
13531 => i got to give you credit manny , youre not the pricy milk toast i figured you to be . 
13532 => my hat is off to you . 
13533 => too bad its bat im sending after you . 
13534 => if it was anyone else , you might have a chance . 
13535 => bat got beat up by my dog , and already missed me once , manny laughed loudly . 
13536 => tainer was silent , waiting for manny to respond again , but manny was done talking , it was time to move . 
13537 => he left the cell phone behind . 
13538 => i guess you dont have anything to say , out there all alone , with bat and me coming to get you . 
13539 => i dont blame you manny , you did a real stupid thing and now youre going to pay . 
13540 => tainer gave bat a nod , and the two men reentered the heavy undergrowth . 
13541 => manny was moving , trying to find his next position . 
13542 => he traversed across the hill slowly . 
13543 => it was incredibly dark , the thick clouds still covering the moon . 
13544 => he used the pen light sparingly and was very conscious of the track he was taking , keeping the last location firmly in his mind , because its where the rigged cell phone is . 
13545 => think , manny , think , the one that does the best wins , and i cant afford to lose this one . 
13546 => come to me wendell , you got me into this , now dont let me down . 
13547 => manny moved down slightly , and then back up into another clump of boulders . 
13548 => he moved around them slightly and stopped . 
13549 => he could barely make out some shapes seventy-five feet awaythe rocks he had come from . 
13550 => manny settled down to wait . 
13551 => manny crouched , listening intently , hopping for a sound to tell him where tainer and bat were , sniffing the air soundlessly , carefully , waiting for a clue . 
13552 => the smells and sounds of the night were all around him . 
13553 => he could hear the chirping of an insect close on his right , down on the ground fifteen feet away . 
13554 => he could smell the damp , decaying vegetation , the pungent smell of an over ripened fruit or flower . 
13555 => something scampered through the leaves going across his front . 
13556 => it sounded small and in a hurry , moving away . 
13557 => a quiet hooting sound came from behind him , but he could tell it was in a tree , high up , so no danger to him . 
13558 => patience , manny , patience . 
13559 => in the far reaches of his mind manny heard a voice , hes not sure if it is his own consciousness , or encouragement from elsewhere . 
13560 => wait for them manny , wait . 
13561 => they dont know what youre up to manny . 
13562 => theyre hoping youre scared and unprepared . 
13563 => manny sat very still , waiting for the first clue . 
13564 => a slight breeze rustled the leaves of the tree he was waiting under . 
13565 => whats that smell , it sure doesnt belong here ? 
13566 => ive smelled that before , but where ? 
13567 => manny lifted his head , raising his chin to get his nose up into the air , but nothing registers , the slight breeze was gone as fast as it appeared . 
13568 => the air moves again , and the faint smell is back . 
13569 => manny sniffed , analyzing the smell . 
13570 => aftershave . 
13571 => that stupid tainer , thats the scent he uses . 
13572 => manny moved his head around . 
13573 => what direction is the breeze coming from ? 
13574 => . 
13575 => . 
13576 => . 
13577 => come on , a little harder . 
13578 => . 
13579 => . 
13580 => . 
13581 => come on , give me a clue . 
13582 => . 
13583 => . 
13584 => . 
13585 => damn , quit again . 
13586 => moments passed . 
13587 => there it is , and its coming from across the hill . 
13588 => gotcha tainer , you bugger . 
13589 => dumb fuck went for the cell phone . 
13590 => in the distance , manny can hear a car coming down the mountain road , still a couple of miles away . 
13591 => god-damnit , pay attention , dont let your mind wander like that , manny scolded himself . 
13592 => im not in a position to make any mistakes . 
13593 => he heard a twig snap across on the other slope , right where he suspected his target to be . 
13594 => he focused his senses to the direction and waited . 
13595 => the car coming down the road drove around a corner and for a moment the headlights point to where the hunt is taking shape . 
13596 => in the brief second the lights are just right , and they splash intermittent light through all the foliage . 
13597 => for the briefest of moments , a mans vague outline is there , fifty feet away . 
13598 => gotcha . 
13599 => it is quickly dark again , but it is enough for manny to register a target . 
13600 => he drew the bow back and steadied his aim , waiting for something to give him the exact spot . 
13601 => ive shot at three deer , but never hit one . 
13602 => i think i didnt want to kill them , and subconsciously missed . 
13603 => i wonder if i will be able to do this ? 
13604 => it was a couple of seconds before manny heard a foot go down on some leaves . 
13605 => manny registered the exact spot in his mind , raised his aim three feet and quickly fired an arrow , but he was careless because the arrow went through the leaves of a tree ten feet away spoiling the shot and making noise , giving away his location . 
13606 => a burst of automatic rifle fire from the left caught manny by surprise . 
13607 => bullets smacked all around him , shredding the leaves and sending chips of rock flying . 
13608 => as he dropped like a stone to the ground , manny felt a sharp pain in his side . 
13609 => he rolled up tight to the rocks . 
13610 => oh shit , they got me . 
13611 => he put his hand to his side and felt blood . 
13612 => oh shit , i wonder how bad this is ? 
13613 => manny flexed his arm and shoulder , then his side . 
13614 => a stinging pain registers , but nothing unbearable . 
13615 => oh man , where the hell did he come from ? 
13616 => oh shit , surprise , im in a world of hurt . 
13617 => dammit , ive really done it , what do i do now ? 
13618 => manny could feel what must be panic coming on . 
13619 => the need to run , to flee , to find safety , anywhere , anyhow . 
13620 => get a hold of yourself . 
13621 => manny can feel something else . 
13622 => im not giving up . 
13623 => then he starts to feel anger . 
13624 => not now . 
13625 => not after ive been wronged . 
13626 => i want to get even . 
13627 => i want to punish whoever is coming to get me , coming to spoil my life , take away my privilege to live . 
13628 => assholes . 
13629 => manny could hear someone walking across the slope , heading right for him . 
13630 => you want me ? 
13631 => manny notched another arrow and raised up to his knees , ignoring the pain in his side . 
13632 => okay people , you might get me , but you are going to pay dearly . 
13633 => and he let loose with the bolt . 
13634 => a scream of pain and surprise pierces the night . 
13635 => whoever is hit , retreated down the hit , cursing loudly . 
13636 => bat ! 
13637 => tainer yelled from down the hill . 
13638 => that fucker just shot me ! 
13639 => kill him ! 
13640 => kill him now , and do it mean ! 
13641 => i think i might have got him ! 
13642 => bat shouted from the location the automatic rifle fired . 
13643 => like hell you did , you moronic elf ! 
13644 => he just nailed me with another fuckin arrow ! 
13645 => kill him now ! 
13646 => golly tainer , that boy is pretty good with that thing . 
13647 => i dont know ? 
13648 => manny fired an arrow at the sound of bats voice , but the arrow struck rock . 
13649 => bat was respecting mannys prowess by hiding behind the rocks . 
13650 => manny could hear bat on the other side of the rocks , maybe sixty feet away . 
13651 => hey anderson ! 
13652 => bat called . 
13653 => i hit you , i know i did . 
13654 => manny said nothing , thinking furiously . 
13655 => shit , im screwed . 
13656 => he can come around the rocks from either side , and i cant do a thing about it . 
13657 => come on mister , give it up , bat called , trying to sound sympathetic . 
13658 => i wont hurt you , i promise . 
13659 => if i have got to come and get you , im going to have to kill you though . 
13660 => manny leaned back against the rocks . 
13661 => hey mister , bat called again . 
13662 => got to do something , got to do something . 
13663 => come on , come on . 
13664 => cant let it end here , not like this . 
13665 => manny pushed away from the rocks and listened carefully . 
13666 => your times up , bat called out . 
13667 => a sudden shift in the heavy clouds overhead allowed a dim outline of the moon to appear . 
13668 => it was just a faint light coming from above , but it seemed to bath the area where bat was hiding , with an eerie glow . 
13669 => there was a cone of light , dim at the outer edges , brighter in toward the middle . 
13670 => manny is transfixed by the strange occurrence . 
13671 => opened something , kennys voice comes to manny . 
13672 => hey bat , manny called out . 
13673 => what kind of deal can we make ? 
13674 => ive got a lot more money than tainer . 
13675 => we can talk , sure , bats voice was illuminated in mannys mind . 
13676 => you can feel him , you know where he is . 
13677 => it was the voice of wendell guterraz . 
13678 => come on out , manny said . 
13679 => i dont want to get stuck with no arrow , bat laughed . 
13680 => all of mannys senses zeroed in on bat . 
13681 => the darkness , the rocks , the trees , anything that stands between the two men , dissolves . 
13682 => manny looked up , raising the bow with an arrow notched , concentrating intensely , the flight path of the arrow outlined in his mind as he stood . 
13683 => throw out the bow ! 
13684 => bat commanded . 
13685 => this declaration from bat gave manny the range and he fired the arrow straight into the air . 
13686 => manny quickly notched another arrow , and let it fly , then a third arrow went , arching high into the night sky . 
13687 => looking up , manny projected his thoughts to the first arrow as it reached the top of its arch and tipped over , gaining speed , plummeting down . 
13688 => going down . 
13689 => manny knew he had connection with the arrow , he could feel it , as the arrow accelerated , closing in on the unsuspecting bat . 
13690 => bang , manny whispered as he heard a plunk and a loud hiccup . 
13691 => moments later , he heard a clank , as an arrow hit a rock , then shortly , followed by another plunk . 
13692 => manny waited , but he couldnt hear anything but the night sounds . 
13693 => finally , the pain in his side made him restless and he couldnt wait any longer . 
13694 => he started slowly , sneaking around the outcrop of rock , another arrow notched in the bow . 
13695 => he got to the end of the rocks , stopped and listened . 
13696 => there was still nothing but the natural sounds . 
13697 => he moved slightly away from the rocks and looked intently to where he knew bat was located last , but there is nothing out of the ordinary . 
13698 => as he focused his eyes , he spotted something . 
13699 => it looked like the feather end of an arrow sticking straight up , just behind one of the boulders . 
13700 => manny moved cautiously , keeping the unmoving arrow in sight , the bow aimed out in front of him . 
13701 => he snuck up to the other side of the rock , steadied himself on the surface , raised up and peered over slowly , following the shaft of the arrow down with his eyes . 
13702 => the arrow seemed to be lodged in something hairy . 
13703 => manny stood up , suddenly realizing what he was looking at . 
13704 => bat , the arrow sticking out of the top of his head , was wedged between two rocks , caught under his arm pits . 
13705 => manny walked up to bat , noticing another arrow protruding from his back and bats ak47 assault rifle laying in the dirt . 
13706 => mannys attention was redirected to the road by a car coming up it . 
13707 => he could see the lights through the trees . 
13708 => bat ! 
13709 => tainer yelled from close to the road . 
13710 => come on , quit screwing around and shoot the bastard , someones coming . 
13711 => manny quickly turned , pulled the bow back and waited . 
13712 => hey bat ! 
13713 => tainer yelled again . 
13714 => manny fired at the voice , sending the arrow arching up at a steep angle . 
13715 => lets get this over , tainer was shouting , as manny waited , counting out the seconds to when he judged the should arrive . 
13716 => now , manny whispered again , as there was the sound of an arrow slicing down through foliage . 
13717 => then there was a shout in the night . 
13718 => god-dammit ! 
13719 => from tainer . 
13720 => manny fired another arrow and started toward tainers voice . 
13721 => manny notched another arrow , as the car on the road got closer . 
13722 => what the hell ? 
13723 => tainer yelled again . 
13724 => manny was almost to the bottom of the slope when heard this . 
13725 => he pulled the bow back and fired another arrow , this time at a shallow angle , listening to the arrow slicing through the underbrush . 
13726 => he could hear tainer scrambling through the thick underbrush as he reached the bottom of the slope . 
13727 => manny shot another arrow and a yelp came from tainer . 
13728 => manny started up the slope toward the road , firing arrows at the sounds tainer was making in his panicked flight . 
13729 => jesus christ anderson , youre nuts ! 
13730 => tainer screamed . 
13731 => leave me alone ! 
13732 => manny loosed another arrow , shooting high , the arrow thwacking into a tree , somewhere above tainers head . 
13733 => tainer panicked , screaming incoherently , iiyyyeeee , help me , help me please ! 
13734 => this fucker is nuts ! 
13735 => tainer screamed , crashing through the brush , trying desperately to break free , to get to the road , to get to the car lights above . 
13736 => manny heard the car come up fast , the tires squealing on the blacktop , then the car stopping hard into the gravel shoulder . 
13737 => doors opened , and he could hear tainer . 
13738 => oh , thank god , thank you , thank you . 
13739 => theres a crazy man down there . 
13740 => hes trying to kill me with a bow . 
13741 => manny stopped , not sure what to do , wondering how much trouble he had gotten himself in now . 
13742 => manny anderson ! 
13743 => a deep strong voice called from the road . 
13744 => this is the sheriff , put down your manny could hear the strong voice asking a question . 
13745 => what , hes after you with what ? 
13746 => the deep voice sounded mystified . 
13747 => really , thats a nasty looking gun you have there , sir . 
13748 => manny could hear the man with the strong voice clearly , and youre running from a guy with a bow ? 
13749 => manny could hear some more unrecognizable blathering . 
13750 => then the strong voice . 
13751 => yes , dont worry , sir , we wont let him shoot at you anymore . 
13752 => manny anderson , the deep voice commanded , drop your bow and arrows , and come on up here , now ! 
13753 => manny could detect a chuckle . 
13754 => manny followed the game trail back up to the road , a couple of lights spotted him as he made his way . 
13755 => he had put the bow down , and was using both hands to part the thick vegetation . 
13756 => he stepped onto the road , lights blaring in his eyes . 
13757 => how do you know my name ? 
13758 => i followed your sorry ass all the way from minnesota , you friggin idiot , detective swenson announced . 
13759 => oh , shit , not you , manny said with disgust . 
13760 => not happy to see me ? 
13761 => swenson said , lowering his light out of mannys eyes . 
13762 => am i interfering with something ? 
13763 => swenson continued , walking up to manny . 
13764 => youve got yourself in some deep shit now , turn around . 
13765 => swenson had handcuffs . 
13766 => now , lets not be hasty , the deep voice said . 
13767 => a huge , black , sheriff walked up . 
13768 => am i to understand that this gentleman , the sheriff pointed at manny , was being pursued by those two other gentleman , and seems to have won the game ? 
13769 => its my case , ill handle it dillard , swenson said condescendingly . 
13770 => this is my jurisdiction shorty , and i dont particularly care for you , sheriff dillard said to swenson . 
13771 => now just a min swenson tried to object , but dillard cut him off . 
13772 => sir , sheriff dillard said to manny , would you please come with me . 
13773 => * manny walked up to the sheriffs car , where mark tainer was in the back seat , leaning forward , handcuffed , a bloody rag wrapped around his lower arm . 
13774 => manny leaned into the window . 
13775 => you fucker tainer , i actually wanted to kill you , and then i remembered the spiel you gave me . 
13776 => how youre the one that deserves to benefit from timtown . 
13777 => how i was such an asshole and didnt deserve to live because i didnt listen to billys dream . 
13778 => you accused me of being responsible for his death . 
13779 => thats right manny , i still think im correct , tainer said . 
13780 => you are , thats why youre such a fucker , manny said , straightening up . 
13781 => by the way , i know this great lawyer , and like a detective once told me , you didnt kill anybody , so it shouldnt go too bad for you . 
13782 => chapter 39 manny was just starting to doze off in the cell hed been put in when a deputy walked up to the bars and informed him he had a phone call . 
13783 => who is it ? 
13784 => manny asked , not even raising his head from the plain , hard , skinny pillow , with no pillow case . 
13785 => he says hes your attorney , a carl something . 
13786 => tell him to call back in the morning , manny said , his head still on the pillow . 
13787 => ah , id appreciate if you would take his this call , the deputy said nervously . 
13788 => arent you afraid im going to try to escape , or something ? 
13789 => dont talk like that , please . 
13790 => didnt they tell you how deranged i am ? 
13791 => sir , i was instructed to get you what you need , and no one thinks youre dangerous , not here anyway . 
13792 => manny got up with a sigh , as the deputy opened the cell door . 
13793 => the deputy directed manny down to an office , pointed the way in , and then shut the door behind manny . 
13794 => hey , carl , guess where i am ? 
13795 => manny said into the phone . 
13796 => i heard , swenson called me . 
13797 => im on my way . 
13798 => theyre waking up a judge to set bail , and well have you out in a couple of hours . 
13799 => oh , chill out , andrews . 
13800 => ive had a long day , and the bunk in here isnt too bad . 
13801 => i plan on sleeping quite a bit , so dont bother me until tomorrow . 
13802 => but , manny , youre in jail . 
13803 => big deal , ive had it worse today , believe me . 
13804 => you are one crazy bugger , thats for sure . 
13805 => good night carl , manny said , hanging up the phone . 
13806 => * around noon the next day , carl and jason mcdermott were in sheriff dillards office when they brought manny in . 
13807 => wheres swenson ? 
13808 => manny asked . 
13809 => hes not welcome here , sheriff dillard remarked , handing manny a newspaper , the headlines showing . 
13810 => minnesota man in custody . 
13811 => arrested after shoot out near lake black shear . 
13812 => the following article read , sheriff dillard says the minnesota gentleman , a manny anderson of red pine , was being pursued by two other men from new york that were trying to kill him . 
13813 => mr 
13814 => anderson , armed with only a compound bow , was able to kill one of his pursuers and disable the other . 
13815 => it is unconfirmed , but according to the sheriffs office in red pine , the two new york men were vietnam era marine snipers . 
13816 => story page 1b . 
13817 => * how did swenson get down here ? 
13818 => manny asked carl . 
13819 => it seems the new york police were very interested in mark tainers associate , the one you proinged with the arrows . 
13820 => they had been following him , a one bat obrien , for six months . 
13821 => they though he might be working for tainer , and swenson was let in on it when you made your mad dash . 
13822 => the police had a gps in tainers car , and tainer and bat had a tail on you the whole time , but it got a little hectic with you and that silly car stan gave you . 
13823 => oh , man , i do love that car . 
13824 => manny smiled . 
13825 => so whats the official line , what happens to me ? 
13826 => the official report will read that you acted in self-defense , dillard said . 
13827 => as far as were concerned , youre free to go , but , if you ever go through here again , and i catch you driving like that , again , i will throw the book at you . 
13828 => * manny requested to see tainer before he left . 
13829 => come to gloat , tainer said , sitting on his bunk in the cell . 
13830 => manny was standing outside the bars , looking in . 
13831 => no , came to talk , manny said . 
13832 => i tried to kill you , tainer said matter of factually . 
13833 => it didnt work . 
13834 => sounds like gloating to me . 
13835 => probably , but i still want to talk . 
13836 => im still interested in billy and you . 
13837 => ah , what makes me tick ? 
13838 => no , why you tick that way . 
13839 => fair enough . 
13840 => i hate you manny anderson . 
13841 => i hate you for becoming billys advocate , way too late , i might add . 
13842 => i could say better late than never , but i think i understand . 
13843 => try me , tainer said . 
13844 => billy needed me , a long , long time ago , and i wasnt there , manny said , sadness in his voice . 
13845 => anderson , you do amaze me , but i still want you dead . 
13846 => it aint gon na happen , not by your hand anyway , manny snickered . 
13847 => youre gloating again , tainer growled . 
13848 => i get to go home , manny said , pointing at tainer , and you are headed to deep shit , but i still want to talk . 
13849 => tainer sat thinking for a moment , then spoke . 
13850 => what do you want ? 
13851 => i got bills story from you , what about yours ? 
13852 => you writing a book anderson ? 
13853 => maybe ! 
13854 => and you want what from me ? 
13855 => the truth . 
13856 => you missed knowing billy the marine and now you think you can figure me out , tainer laughed . 
13857 => maybe . 
13858 => manny anderson , you want to know why im the way i am ? 
13859 => yes , manny said without hesitation . 
13860 => tainer sat thinking again , finally taking a deep breath . 
13861 => i was disfigured by war , he said and stopped . 
13862 => thats a start , manny commented . 
13863 => i never told you about the dogs , tainer said , a faraway look on his face . 
13864 => manny sat waiting . 
13865 => those beautiful dogs , tainer said quietly . 
13866 => they were dedicated to us . 
13867 => they were smart enough to realize the danger and how extreme the situation could become . 
13868 => they adored their handlers and would give it all . 
13869 => manny could tell tainer was getting angry . 
13870 => when the handlers rotated back to the world , the dogs were not allowed to leave vietnam and were given to the south vietnamese army who had them for lunch ! 
13871 => tainer spat it out venomously . 
13872 => of all the jack ass stupidity involved in that fiasco , to me that was the defining action . 
13873 => how some moron in the rear could justify leaving our soldiers behind , and thats what they were , soldiers . 
13874 => they were part of the team , and gave their all , tainer exclaimed . 
13875 => manny saw a look of hatred on marks face . 
13876 => ive never talked about this manny , not to anyone before . 
13877 => ive never talked about it until now . 
13878 => tainer twisted his head around , trying to loosen his tense neck . 
13879 => tainer sat thinking , then said softly . 
13880 => a man that goes to war , never comes back the same . 
13881 => how could he ? 
13882 => manny said . 
13883 => we found five marines one time , tainer said in the same soft voice . 
13884 => i guess a patrol got lost and was overwhelmed . 
13885 => they were badly decomposed , stinking , bones showing through the rot in places , but we could tell that they had been castrated and their genitals were in their mouths . 
13886 => i only hoped that this had been done after they were dead , but i doubt it . 
13887 => the enemy had a pretense for extreme cruelty . 
13888 => as bad as it got , we tried to refrain from becoming his equal . 
13889 => in my mind , it was what separated us from the other side . 
13890 => we were all in that filthy , stinking environment , but we were better , we still had a limit to what we were capable of . 
13891 => and the kids , tainer added . 
13892 => i have to say that regardless of how bad the situation , our troops still had a heart for the children . 
13893 => men , or rather boys that had been confronted with the most intense combat , still remembered that kids are kids , and tried to refrain from any retribution toward them . 
13894 => the other side , their own people , were vicious and absolute about their goals , and never hesitated to abuse anyone that didnt go along with their policies . 
13895 => what do you think made the difference ? 
13896 => manny asked . 
13897 => i think its that freedom of expression that we take for granted . 
13898 => in a society that is totalitarian , orders are orders , and there is no pretense to question anything . 
13899 => they spend their whole life taking orders , and that is that . 
13900 => individual rights and thoughts are not part of the equation . 
13901 => yeah , i learned all about possibly losing my rights out there in the woods with you and bat after my ass . 
13902 => so what got your balls in a twist ? 
13903 => i was pissed because you were fucking with my great life . 
13904 => if you had nothing to miss , how do you think you would have responded ? 
13905 => i dont know , ive never been in that situation . 
13906 => did you think about billy ? 
13907 => yes , i never thought about his experiences having anything to offer to me , until i needed courage , manny said , turning to leave . 
13908 => chapter 40 i dont get you manny , cassey said , sitting in the passengers side of the vet . 
13909 => they had decided to take a drive down the road where cassey had been assaulted . 
13910 => to get their life back , cassey had said . 
13911 => after all the trouble that guy caused , you dont hold a grudge . 
13912 => hes nothing but a wicked killer in my book , cassey stated , looking out her window , watching the trees go by . 
13913 => hes a bad guy , no doubt , manny agreed , and he was motivated by greed , yes , but not totally . 
13914 => manny looked at cassey . 
13915 => part of him tried to kill out of comradely for billy . 
13916 => we became the enemy because we were about to reap the benefits of that war . 
13917 => timtown is a story of a character that holds all the cards and chooses not to use them . 
13918 => tainer and billy lived that for a time in that war . 
13919 => they had the choice of life and death and used it responsibly , wisely . 
13920 => responsibly ? 
13921 => cassey questioned , turning to look at manny . 
13922 => how can you say that ? 
13923 => they were out hunting people . 
13924 => no , they were doing a job . 
13925 => tainer told me how billy was very careful to make sure they evaluated their targets , manny explained . 
13926 => tainer was right , we only recognized timtown for its market value , not for what it tried to say . 
13927 => cassey nodded her head in acknowledgment . 
13928 => im very proud of you manny , she said leaning over . 
13929 => weve been together a long time and that can be the death knoll for many marriages . 
13930 => people get bored with each other really easy , but this has put a spark back in my heart for you , she said , laying her head on his shoulder . 
13931 => i think ill keep you for a bit longer . 
13932 => im still a little pissed , though , about how careless you where , but i can forgive you because it wasnt what it seemed . 
13933 => imagine , the nerve of that tainer . 
13934 => what put you on to him ? 
13935 => it wasnt too hard to figure out after i had read timtown , and the shit started happening , manny said . 
13936 => i thought , damn , i sure wish i could have written something as great as this . 
13937 => you said the same thing . 
13938 => then when tainer dispelled the book , i was thinking , cassey loved it , why didnt mark tainer ? 
13939 => thats what got me thinking . 
13940 => then i remembered something he had said to me earlier , when i first met him . 
13941 => he was very frustrated that he had never written a book . 
13942 => from then on , i kind of knew what was happening , i just had to prove it , and someone was feeding that dip shit swenson , it had to be either you or tainer . 
13943 => you were suspicious of me ? 
13944 => cassey asked , lifting her head and looking at manny . 
13945 => no , not really because you had nothing to gain . 
13946 => besides , i know you well enough . 
13947 => if you wanted to get rid of me , you would have just done it , not pulled some dastardly deed . 
13948 => it must have seemed that way , that i didnt want you anymore , at least for a while ? 
13949 => you thought i did something bad . 
13950 => if i had really done it , i wouldnt have blamed you . 
13951 => how pragmatic . 
13952 => cassey , i started out wondering how the hell billy got overlooked , then how he must have felt . 
13953 => all of a sudden i was the one on the outside looking in , being accused and not being guilty . 
13954 => when you end up standing in those shoes , the only thing that matters is getting the true story out , for me anyway . 
13955 => i had a lot to lose , and i had to clear myself .

13958 => we really had nothing to do with it . 
13959 => how could we , we were just kids and he was a man ?
